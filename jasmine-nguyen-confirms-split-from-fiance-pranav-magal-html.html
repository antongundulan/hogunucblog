She and Pranav, a doctor specializing in Anesthesiology, began their journey together in 2019. Despite her initial appearance on the show, Jasmine’s heart led her to Pranav, and their love story blossomed.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>A Proposal to Remember</strong></h3><p>In December, Pranav asked Jasmine to be his wife, and the world got a glimpse of their happiness through Jasmine’s social media posts. She joyfully shared the news with Bachelor Nation, saying, “MY FREAKIN FIANCÉ !!!! We are on cloud nine. Dec 3, 2019 – Our very first date.

Speculations grew about the state of their relationship as weeks went by without any official word.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Heartfelt Confirmation</strong></h3><p>Finally, on February 21, Jasmine broke her silence in a heartfelt video message to her followers.
