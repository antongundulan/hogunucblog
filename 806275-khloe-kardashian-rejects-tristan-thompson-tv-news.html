At one point in the episode, Tristan joked that they should combine both of their homes with a tunnel so they can easily reach each other. According to him, they'd be able to "just live as one big happy family." Unsurprisingly, she looked <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">less than enthused</a> by the suggestion, rolling her eyes and just barely cracking a smile.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-khloe-kardashian-is-over-it>Khloe Kardashian Is Over It</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Mm, No,"</a> she said as Thompson continued to compare their relationship to various "dynamic duos." In a confessional, Khloe explained how it can be frustrating to maneuver the relationship. She said she has to be careful not to give her ex any ideas. "I mean come on, let's just... You know where I stand," she began. "Sometimes I hate how much I have to think and be on guard to not do anything that might ever give a glimmer that there's hope."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After chatting with Thompson for a bit, Khloe gave him a hug. She then urged him to "let go" after he held on for a bit too long. She also told him not to "walk so close" to her on their way out.
