Reid says. In an interview with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> XXL</a>, the producer revealed that Nicki "went in [the recording booth], started rapping, came out, arranged it, went back in, finished it."

The whole song, mixed, mastered, production, writing, finishing the record, everything done this past weekend." He said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition, he also revealed that Nicki Minaj also "went crazy" when recording "Barbie Tingz."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I played one beat, [then] I played the second beat and she was like, “Stop, pull it up, I'm about to go in.” I'm like, “This is crazy. Is she really finna go rap on my beat, like, freestyle?!” And went crazy." He said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">J.
