Funny enough, the idea for Shields's collection was sparked after a chance meeting with MAC's Senior VP James Gager, who ran into the star sans-makeup after running errands. "There's this little place I go to get coffee after I drop my kids off for school and after a yoga or spin class, where I think no one will see me without makeup," she tells <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WWD</a>. "Of course, who do I run into but James, Mr. MAC? After we talked a few times, he approached me about the next Icon line and asked if I would consider designing it with them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We couldn't think of a better person to add to the Icon family, and Shields was up for the job. Following her conversation with Gager, she began digging through the products she loves as a starting point. "I went through all my makeup, opened it all up, and started to decide what of each product I loved—whether it was from MAC or some obscure brand I got on a shoot in Japan," she adds. "So many times you get asked to 'create' something, but it ends up being 'put your face on this.' I got to run with this, and I loved every detail of it." The final result was a 15-product lineup—the largest of any Icon collection to date—which includes a massive 16-pan shadow palette, nail polishes, lipsticks, glosses, and of course, brow products. Even the product packaging got a special Brooke Shields touch, trading the traditional black color scheme for an orange and grey motif, which mirrors the interior of the star's New York City home.
