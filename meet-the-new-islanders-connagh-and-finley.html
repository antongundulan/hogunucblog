But Thursday's episode is possibly going to be the most dramatic of the series so far as two new Islanders are strutting in to shake up the South African pad. So who are these new contenders? Here's all you need to know about Connagh and Finley…</p><p id=eMfrmB71z_Qk data-wc=12><strong>WATCH: Take a look around the Love Island villa with Laura Whitmore</strong></p><h2>Connagh Howard</h2><p id=edJEJ3AGzdXQ data-wc=81>First up we have Cardiff's finest, Connagh Howard. The 27-year-old works as a model and rates himself as an 8.5 out of 10 no less. According to his social media, he is also signed up to an acting agency and has even appeared in an advert with boxing champ Anthony Joshua. He told ITV: "I'm a big boxing fan. I was really excited to meet him. In the ad we are both training. It was pretty nerve-wracking, he's a big boy!"</p><p id=eUMacZwTALgF data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Paige Turley: inside the Love Island star's relationship with Lewis Capaldi</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ced33f1efb92-connagh-new-islander-series-6-z.jpg><p id=ezqvAKFOqZa3 data-wc=6><strong>Connagh is a model from Cardiff</strong></p><p id=eMI11Tfg5Lil data-wc=76>Speaking in an interview prior to entering the villa, he told ITV: "I like brunettes, a girl with nice eyes, who likes to take care of themselves. I'm looking for someone I can be myself with." And it seems that Connagh already has his sights set on some of the girls. "I fancy Shaughna, Sophie and Siânnise." Shaughna is currently single after being un-coupled from Callum, Sophie is coupled up with Connor, and Siânnise with Nas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09c5c8124da5-sophie-and-connagh-go-on-date-z.jpg><p id=esyA86twGkXT data-wc=10><strong>Connagh invites Sophie on his first date in the villa</strong></p><p id=eDnu4mEpPUsI data-wc=111>After Connagh arrived in the villa, as viewers will see in Thursday's episode, he first invited Sophie out for a date in a romantic vineyard while the others (mainly Connor, let's face it) waited nervously back at the villa. And on the date, Sophie was open to Connagh about her situation with Connor (let's be thankful their names are spelt differently), as she told the new boy: "I feel like I am happy with Connor. But obviously we're only a couple of days in so it would be silly to close myself off completely, so we'll have to see how the next couple of days go." Could Sophie's head be turned?</p><h2>Finley Tapp</h2><p id=e4TgVxxdqZqD data-wc=75>The second Islander heading into the villa is Finley Tapp. The 20-year-old (knows as Finn) is a recruitment consultant from Milton Keynes and describes himself as "outgoing and good looking" – modest, too. In his interview prior to entering the villa, the recruiter revealed that he tends to meet dates through work. "I usually tend to meet people in real life, like through work or people I know. I don't tend to do online dating."</p><p id=eDZNAM4m0PP- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How is Love Island's Sophie related to Rochelle Humes?

Like Connagh, Finn's going in with a strong idea of what he's looking for. "I want a girl who is fun and outgoing and someone who can make me laugh. I don't have a type looks wise but obviously you want that initial attraction," he said. Finley also revealed that he has his eye on Paige, who's currently single after <a class=hm-link href=#>Ollie Williams decided to leave the show</a>. But, again similar to Connagh, the contestant also likes the look of Sophie and Siânnise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/538fa664d43a-siannese-and-finn-date-z.jpg><p id=ecKr6BT3gMNt data-wc=8><strong>Siânnise seemed to enjoy her date with Finn</strong></p><p id=e25gkTdwwQzp data-wc=73>For Finn's first date, he invited Siânnise to the picturesque vineyard and the two seemingly got on well. Siânnise, who works as a beauty consultant, told the Beach Hut after the date, "I feel like there was a little bit of a spark there. He did have something about him and I did think he was really good looking – so who knows?"
