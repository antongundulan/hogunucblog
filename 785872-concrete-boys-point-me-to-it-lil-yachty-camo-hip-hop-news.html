The Concrete Boys members that listeners will hear on "POINT ME TO IT" are Yachty and Camo! They trade verses over a guitar and drill instrumental. Right off the bat, you may be wondering, "How does this make sense?"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-point-me-to-it-by-concrete-boys>Listen To "POINT ME TO IT" By Concrete Boys</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Honestly, we aren't really sure how it does either, but with Yachty's creative genius, anything is possible. What is even crazier is that the beat switches up in the second half, getting slightly more aggressive and fast-paced. Camo! and Lil Boat's voices also do not clash too much either, but they do have just enough differentiation to make things interesting. All in all, it is a great intro cut and it shows the unlimited potential for the Concrete Boys identity going forward.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new song, "POINT ME TO IT," by Concrete Boys, Lil Yachty, and Camo!
