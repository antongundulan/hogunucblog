Superman: Dawn of Justice" in 2016, he was catapulted back into the spotlight. While his role in the film was a supporting one, it did pave the way for the actor to be involved in other films as the superhero character, such as "Justice League" in 2017 and the billion-dollar hit "Aquaman" in 2018. "Aquaman," of course, really boosted his celebrity status — and yes, his net worth. The film smashed box office records and became the highest-grossing DC film of all time, earning $334.8 million in domestic sales with a total of $1.1 billion worldwide, according to <a href=#>Deadline</a>. The actor's income from "Aquaman" reflected the film's incredible budget and astonishing earnings, with Momoa reportedly getting $15 million for his role as the superhero, per <a href=#>Newsweek</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>The film's sequel, "Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom" is set to release in 2023, with Momoa reprising his role as the film's lead character once again. While the exact budget of the upcoming film is unknown, given the success and huge cost of the first film, "Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom" will likely follow in its predecessors footsteps.</p><p dir=ltr>Regarding the character, Momoa said on "<a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" in 2021 that he enjoys playing the superhero, though he can get carried away with the action sequences. "I love my job and I get a little too excited — then the age thing, you know, I'm an aging superhero right now," he shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9nZoJye8eormalpZi1brXSZqGaq5%2Bjeq67zKiYZpmTqcKiuMuyZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
