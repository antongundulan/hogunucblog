There were skinny brows, colored contacts, and the deepest of side parts. And we have to talk about that stiletto manicure.</p><p>On Monday, January 1, the "Bongos" rapper posted a series of Instagram <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1kqkqcOnSo/?img_index=2" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>photos</a> from New Year's Eve, when she performed at Fontainebleau in Miami and took to the town with her estranged husband, Offset.</p><p>"What’s love got to do wit it?" she captioned the post alongside a winking emoji—a subtle nod to who she spent the night with.</p><p>In the first photo, the New Yorker shows off her appearance from head-to-toe, complete with a skintight dress by Sergio Castaño Peña. In the image, she stands against a wall and glances over her shoulder—the ideal pose to show off her hairstyle. Styled with a deep (and sharp) side part, her back-to-brunette locks were pressed into voluminous, romantic curls by her hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/tokyostylez/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Tokyo Stylez</a>, a.k.a.

Painted a soft pink, the mile-long stiletto nails by manicurist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/nailson7th/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jenny Bui</a> feature a French manicure-shaped smattering of gems and jewels. And yes, they look <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/cardi-b-sharp-olive-manicure/>sharp enough to pierce an olive</a>.</p><p>"Bringing in the New Year with a successful bling set for Cardi B," wrote Bui via <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1kL5egLadZ/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Instagram</a>. "Want to hear about the behind the scenes? We didn’t have that much time cause Cardi is busy busy busy, but I always make sure I come through for my girl! Started her nails from the house to the car to the airport. I think I did an amazing job on the go, how about you? Every stone was placed with love."</p><p>Cardi, thank you for kicking off 2024 for us in the very best way. If this is how we're starting, I can only imagine what else the year will have in store.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6cmKucmWKvbrrEsGSynZGnwG6x1Z5koKSRonw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
