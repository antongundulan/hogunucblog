Over the years, Drake has treated Adonis to some pretty cool experiences for a boy his age.

They were on a private jet! Apparently, Drake "chartered a private jet for them on Christmas," shared an anonymous source.&nbsp;Drake has also enriched Adonis' life by introducing him to new, fun experiences.&nbsp;In 2021, Adonis accompanied Drake as <a href=#>he accepted his "Artist of the Decade" award during the Billboard Awards</a>, per <a href=#>Variety</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnZ4RzgI6dqZqjlWLAsLqMmpuoppmoeqbE06ucpp2crnqtrdWiqqFlnJ6zpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
