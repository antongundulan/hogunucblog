The rumors arrived due to several other stories about the actor, including the big news that his wife has filed for divorce in the past few days.

The fictional show is a Neo-Western drama series focused on the Yellowstone Ranch, Yellowstone National Park, Broken Rock Indian reservation, and land developers’ conflicts involving the region’s shared borders.</p><p>Yellowstone’s creators are Taylor Sheridan and John Linson, who are also credited as executive producers with Costner, Art Linson, and David C.
