During the first few years, his role there will be marginal and ill defined.</p><p>Standard Oil contributes $250,000 to Republican William McKinley's&nbsp;presidential campaign against Democrat William Jennings Bryan, a supporter of antitrust legislation. The candidates' opposing views about trusts polarize public opinion on the issue.</p><p><strong>1898</strong><br>Between 1898 and 1902, many follow the Rockefeller business model; 198 trusts are created in coal, sugar, and other industries.</p><p><strong>1901</strong><br>J.
