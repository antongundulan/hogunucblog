It’s a “quiet drop” by the brand’s standards; normally, they’re teasing new products months in advance.</p><p>Still, just like its predecessors, the blurring-smoothing-setting powder grabbed shoppers' attention. Over the past few days, TikTok creators who were lucky enough to score some early samples have provided glimpses of the product’s powers to the masses. They’ve dropped intel that the True to Myself Tinted Pressed Finishing Powder initially debuted at the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/best-dolce-and-gabbana-beauty-perfumes/>Dolce & Gabanna</a> Alta Moda show in Italy two weeks back. They’ve thrown compliments left, right, and sideways, too. “It’s doing god’s work” and “literally gorgeous” sum up the online sentiment.</p><a title=@lindceybeautyy href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@lindceybeautyy referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@lindceybeautyy</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Lindcey Nava" href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7391519824662367007 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>♬ original sound - Lindcey Nava</a> <a title=@kay_caputo href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@kay_caputo referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@kay_caputo</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Kayla Caputo" href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7390044657457842986 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>♬ original sound - Kayla Caputo</a><p>Marie Claire was also one of the lucky recipients—Rare Beauty sent the full Tinted Pressed Finishing Powder range to our office last week. Our team of expert testers was, candidly, a bit skeptical: Not one of us is a diehard fan pressed powder fan. Still, we reviewed the product according to finish, coverage, and longevity—and quite frankly, it seems everyone who gets their hands on the powder is glad they tried it. Our honest reviews are ahead, in their entirety.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-sets-rare-beauty-s-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-apart><span>What Sets Rare Beauty's Tinted Pressed Finishing Powder Apart?</span></h2><p>When you look at the setting powder market (a quick Sephora search will do the trick), you’ll find that the offerings are most frequently problem-solution-oriented. One will mattify oil, another will brighten your <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/g2723/best-under-eye-concealers/>under-eye</a>, and something else can be employed to blur over <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a13395/pore-minimizing-tips/>pores</a>. Rare, however, set out to do it all—and do it all at once. The product claims to “blur, smooth, and set,” while absorbing excess oil.</p><p>The powder can be used on bare skin for a subtle boost, on top of foundation for added coverage, or on top of concealer to set makeup and prevent creasing. It's perhaps one of the brand's most versatile launches to date.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Not only can <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.drugwatch.com/talcum-powder/is-talc-in-makeup-safe/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>talc irritate sensitive skin</a>, but in certain concentrations and derivatives, it’s been shown to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>cause respiratory issues</a> or lead to cancer. With that in mind, many makeup products still include a finely milled version of the ingredient in powder cosmetics. Avoiding talc is a personal choice (many experts claim it's safe in cosmetics), but Rare has chosen to err on the side of caution.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez True to Myself Tinted Pressed Talc-Free Finishing Powder" data-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-true-to-myself-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-P512330 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-true-to-myself-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-P512330&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rmiBN2dkVyQyG6kyfZc3e-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez True to Myself Tinted Pressed Talc-Free Finishing Powder</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-editors-honest-reviews><span>Editors' Honest Reviews</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rmiBN2dkVyQyG6kyfZc3e-1920-80.jpg><p>"I’ve always been a translucent powder girl. Tinted formulas, candidly, terrify me. Typically, they’re just a magnifying glass for imperfections and texture. But Selena hasn’t steered me wrong yet (I’m a Soft Pinch Blush devotee), so I owed it to her to give the compact a try.</p><p>"Before I get into my thoughts on the physical product, I want to give the packaging a little shout out. It’s incredibly easy to open and is accompanied by a cute little mirror that makes on-the-go application easy.</p><p>"As for the product itself? It’s impressive. It’s very lightweight and not cakey in the slightest. A very soft dusting smoothed out my under-eyes and mattified any oiliness on my complexion. My only note: The colors do skew a bit orange, so if you’re a pale girl like me, choose a shade lighter than you think you need."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez True to Myself Tinted Pressed Talc-Free Finishing Powder" data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-true-to-myself-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-P512330?skuId=2787992" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?skuId=2787992&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-true-to-myself-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-P512330%3FskuId%3D2787992&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZzK8G5R2EYPBQE9RDv3RX-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez True to Myself Tinted Pressed Talc-Free Finishing Powder</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/reThyFiBJvHHmyfoj4VpNX-1920-80.png><p>"When I hear 'pressed powder,' my mind conjures up images of my grandma in front of her vanity, getting ready for a drive in her 1975 Chevy. I’m being slightly dramatic, but in short, I’m not a pressed powder girl because I feel older whenever I wear them. I strive for a soft, dewy finish and most pressed powders are way too drying—and the formula settles into my fine lines. But this Rare Beauty newbie is the pressed powder for people who hate pressed powder. The coverage is on the lighter end, but it’s easy to build upon. I added concealer where needed, but the powder could’ve served as both. My final thought? It blurred redness and evened my skin tone, and that’s a major win."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez True to Myself Tinted Pressed Talc-Free Finishing Powder" data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-true-to-myself-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-P512330?skuId=2788008" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?skuId=2788008&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-true-to-myself-tinted-pressed-finishing-powder-P512330%3FskuId%3D2788008&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sVvhaefHrXu5oeNYEEyo8n-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez True to Myself Tinted Pressed Talc-Free Finishing Powder</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZzK8G5R2EYPBQE9RDv3RX-1920-80.jpg><p>"I don't wear makeup very often, and I like to keep things natural when I do. I never really use powder: I'm more of a 'use setting spray and hope for the best' kind of girl, because powder tends to cake on me. This powder had the opposite effect. I really enjoy the silky texture of it and that it's not heavy on my skin. I never noticed how much shine and texture I get from not having a finishing powder.

However, this one from Rare is so microfine that it doesn't make my skin look patchy or flaky.

To really seal the deal, I lightly pressed some powder onto the t-zone and around the nose, which are the oiliest parts of my face. My final result was smoother under-eyes, less noticeable pores, and whole lot less shine.
