One of the network’s veteran actors, Misha Collins, spent 12 years on Supernatural but will now be playing Gotham D.A. <a href=#>Harvey Dent</a>, the man that becomes Two-Face. To ring in the New Year, Collins shared a time-lapse on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, of getting into character as one of Batman’s most tragic, and best, villains.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Gotham Knights takes place in a world that just lost Batman, with Oscar Morgan as Turner Hayes, the adopted son of Bruce Wayne, Fallon Smythe bringing Harper Row to life from the comic pages, Tyler DiChiara as Harper’s brother, Navia Robinson is Carrie Kelly, the Robin from the classic The Dark Night Returns while Anna Lore is Stephanie Brown, another Robin and a current Batgirl. In addition to the heroes, Hayes is supported by the children of some of Batman’s villains, Olivia Rose Keegan as Duela Dent, the daughter of The Joker, and Rahart Adams as Brody March, son of Lincoln March, an underrated villain.</p><p>Misha Collins as Harvey Dent is likely to start out going after Turner Hayes, before somehow becoming Two-Face and developing into a much deadlier problem for the young heroes. The last time the character appeared in live-action was in The Dark Knight, played by Aaron Eckhart, with Heath Ledger’s The Joker responsible for Gotham’s White Knight getting disfigured. On<a href=#> Gotham</a>, Nicolas D’Agosto played Harvey Dent, but this time around the character never made the transformation into Two-Face.</p><p>We know Misha Collins will end up playing Two-Face, though the actor’s clip confirms that this version will be close to the iconic portrayal from Batman: The Animated Series with the upturned lip and blue skin. Eckhart’s Two-Face was melted with gaping holes, while Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever was purple with what looked like horrible acne. Hopefully Gotham Knights will capture what has made the villain develop into one of Batman’s best villains, which has nothing to do with the facial scares, and everything to do with the character’s emotional scars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Two-Face_BTAS.jpg><p>Batman: The Animated Series, in addition to providing us with the best Batman, helped humanize most of the Gotham rogues’ gallery, including Two-Face. The cartoon was the first to depict Harvey Dent as Bruce’s best friend prior to his accident, often leaning on Bruce’s conflicted nature in trying to reconnect with his old friend while attempting to stop Two-Face’s latest crime. Misha Collin’s Two-Face may or may not have been friends with Bruce, we’ll have to wait for Gotham Knights to debut, but here’s hoping the character’s conflicted, dual nature is used to the most of its potential.</p><p>Gotham Knights released its first trailer many months ago, to a mostly negative reception, with fans upset over another Batman series without Batman. The recent video game, also called Gotham Knights, had a similar plot though it focused on the first three Robins and Batgirl, and also was met with a mostly lackluster reception. Could Misha Collins, and a Two-Face similar to the character’s best version, be what makes the television show succeed when the <a href=#>video game failed</a>?</p><p>Gotham Knights debuts on the CW on Tuesday, March 14th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ilmai1onnCqKOloZ6oerXDzmadmpuVY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
