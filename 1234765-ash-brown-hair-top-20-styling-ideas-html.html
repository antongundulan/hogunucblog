What does this mean? It means that it requires a lot of care routine. If you dye your hair an ashy shade, be ready to spend a lot of time and money on hair care products.</p><h2>How to get ash brown color?</h2><p class=align-left>Blond girls are lucky in this case. If they want to change their colour to ashy brown hair, all they have to do is simply dye it. If you have dark or black hair, you will need to bleach it first. Yes, it may be not so “healthy” for it, but it is the only way to do it. Plus, if you take care of it properly, you will not face any problems in the future.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4180644a31786d29.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rock these amazing short hairstyles for black women in 2019</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As everything is clear with blond now, we will take a look at the specifics of dyeing brown and black natural color.</p><h3>Dyeing medium or brown hair</h3><p class=align-left>If your natural hair colour is brown, you can make it cooler by using a particular type of shampoo.</p><ul><li>Buy a toning shampoo. There are a lot of variations of such shampoos in beauty stores today. Be careful. You have to choose the one for brown hair only, not blond. Such shampoos are meant to remove orange and yellow tones, which means that they add some cool shade to your hair colour.</li><li>Make your hair wet and wash your hair with toning shampoo. There are some issues you should know:</li></ul><li>The shampoo may be green or blue, do not be afraid; it does not mean that the result is going to be blue or green too.</li><li>When applying the shampoo, gently massage it all over your head, from roots to ends.</li><li>Do not wash it off too fast. Leave it on your head for some minutes. Each brand may work differently, so read the instructions carefully. Some shampoos may require five minutes, some ten and some twenty.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6b44d3f8e316ddeb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best jeans gown ideas for you to wear in 2019</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nigerian natural hair weaving styles</p><ul><li>Wash the shampoo off, dry your hair and enjoy your new look.</li></ul><h3>Dyeing black hair</h3><p class=align-left>As we said, black hair requires more actions before making it ashy.</p><ul><li>Buy the bleaching kit. Be careful when choosing one..</li><li>Prepare an old towel to cover your clothing. Take a pair of disposable gloves to protect your hands. You may open a window as well because the smell of bleach may be pungent.</li><li>Read the instructions on how to prepare the bleach itself. Usually, it comes with cream and powder. You have to mix all that. Do not use a metal container to blend the “ingredients,” it is better to do it in a plastic one.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4180644a31786d29.png><ul><li>Part your hair into two sections. Use clips to separate it.</li><li>Start applying the bleach to your hair. Start from the ends on your bottom part, because the hair there is thicker and it will not damage as fast as the upper part. You can use your hands or get a special tinting brush and use it.</li><li>After you applied the bleach all over your head, cover it with a shower cap. This makes the bleach work faster and it keeps everything around you clean as well.</li><li>Usually, you should wash out the bleach in about 10-30 minutes. Read the instructions carefully. Each brand offers different time. Never leave it longer than the recommended time.</li><li>Wash your hair with shampoo but do not use conditioner.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aa6dc6fa8a58fc07.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fresh ideas of weave and braided hairstyles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now as we have bleached our hair, it may have warm shade. Do not panic. It was just a half of work, now it is time to add the desirable shade.</p><ul><li>Buy light ash brown or dark ash brown hair dye, whatever you choose. Mix the dye according to the instructions. Such rules as wearing gloves and protecting your clothes still apply here.</li><li>Apply the dye and this time you have to start from your roots. It is better to work by separating your hair into layers.</li><li>Leave the dye for about 20-30 minutes (remember that the time is always written on the package, read the instruction and learn all the aspects before using the dye).</li><li>Wash your hair with cold water. This time you can use the conditioner. It is better to use the conditioner from the dye package. It has the best result usually. Keep it for 2-3 minutes and wash it off.</li><li>Now you can enjoy your new style.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/34486793ca5d526c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to look younger at any age?</span></p></a><h2>20 styling ideas for ashy brown color</h2><p class=align-left>Having a beautiful hair color is a good thing, but styling it is even better.
