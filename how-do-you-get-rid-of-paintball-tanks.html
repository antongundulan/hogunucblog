While greater muzzle velocity is possible, it has been ruled unsafe for use on most commercial paintball fields.<h2>How much psi can a paintball gun handle?</h2>In most cases, paintball guns use compressed air tanks with high pressure ratings, generally ranging from 3000 psi up to 5000 psi. The paintball guns balance the pressure using a regulator connected to the piping to achieve the ideal output.<h2>What kind of air do paintball guns use?</h2>CO2 and compressed air (HPA) are high-pressure gases that are required to power paintball guns. When CO2 is stored in a CO2 bottle, it is in liquid form. Letting only a little CO2 out of the bottle at a time allows for just gas to come out. This gas is what's used to fire the paintball marker or paintball gun.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormacn2LGsMGMoJytZaKesW67xWanmqGeqa%2BiuMtmq5qmm6g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
