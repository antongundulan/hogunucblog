For example, a list of times in which the businessman used his facilities or his merchandise for people in need, which is provided by <a href=#>AllSides</a>, is lengthy. When a hurricane struck in 2007, he used his company's moving trucks to rescue hundreds of people from flooded streets while also supplying tens of thousands of people with food and shelter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he started a free vocational school where kids could learn plumbing and mechanics for students who didn't finish high school. At Christmas, according to <a href=#>Free Enterprise Land</a>, he gives away furniture to families in need.</p><p dir=ltr>He's also helped finance an anti-drug film, campaigned for the 2008 Olympics to come to Houston, and built a practice facility for the Houston Rockets.&nbsp;McIngvale also had the backs of U.S. soldiers. For example, the <a href=#>Houston Chronicle</a> notes that in the summer of 2022, he provided $20,000 in free furniture to a U.S. Army servicemember who was wounded in <a href=#>Afghanistan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"My father was a giver. He gave all his life. It left a tremendous influence on me, my siblings, and his grandchildren. He died without a lot of money because he gave it all away. But he died happily and led a rich and fulfilling life because he gave to other people," he told <a href=#>Forbes</a> of his inspiration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3JqcW9hZLequYymmK2soprAtHnMmpqkZZ2Ytq%2Bz1ZqjnqtdnrukvsSdoJuklWK5qrLEZqqtp6KueqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
