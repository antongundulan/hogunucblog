Given the sequel’s massive box-office success, it’s little surprise that the studio behind the film waited only a month after Pitch 2‘s release to line up the next installment in its a cappella franchise. 
With Pitch 2 still in theaters, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that screenwriter Kay Cannon and stars Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson were already on board for a Pitch 3, and Kendrick took to social media to officially announce the news quickly thereafter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After reuniting over drinks, the former teammates decide to bring the a capella team together one more time to perform overseas as part of the USO tour to support the troops. While it appears that Steinfeld’s Emily is still a student at the university, she will join the Bellas for the international tour.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><strong>WHERE</strong></p><p>While the first two installments were filmed on and around Louisiana State University’s campus in Baton Rouge, the majority of&nbsp;Pitch Picture 3&nbsp;will be set in Europe. The second trailer for the film reveals that the first military base the team visits is in Spain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHEN</strong></p><p>The film has changed its release date several times. Given an original summer date of July 21, 2017, the film was then pushed back to Aug. 4, 2017 before returning to its <a href=# rel=noopener>original date</a>.

The trailer shows Barden Bella members played by Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Rebel Wilson and Hailee Steinfeld perfect their sound for the USO competition. After getting a look at their competition, Kendrick asks, “”Is it weird that everybody is better at the one thing we do than we are at that thing?” The trailer also features a first look at the third installment’s annual riff-off that is featured in each film.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Photos: Universal Pictures</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLG105yfZqiVp7Omr9Nmamadppq%2FusDHoqWgZaeaeqy6zrBkqaqVoramvsRmm5qslWKwor%2FTZqelp6Risaq%2BxJyrqKpdbYZzgpNuZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
