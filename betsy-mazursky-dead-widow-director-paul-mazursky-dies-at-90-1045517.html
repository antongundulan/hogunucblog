Mazursky, a librarian and social worker, died Friday at her home in Beverly Hills.
Paul had said of his wife, “She’s helped shape a lot of my ideas about women,” and their experiences together informed his scripts. For instance, when the couple went on a 72-hour weekend trip to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, they ended up sitting naked in a hot tub with strangers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He co-wrote the screenplay with Larry Tucker and directed it.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><span data-scayt_word=Mazursky data-scaytid=6>Mazursky</span> met her husband at New York City’s Washington Square fountain.
