The comedian, actress, dancer, and social justice advocate frequently weighs in on struggles the Black community faces. She's also been a vocal critic of prominent Black spaces, accusing them of leaving her out and failing to recognize her for her work. While this has earned Seales a loyal fanbase, it's also earned her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a great deal of backlash</a>. Regardless, she continues to speak her mind.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was Seales' outspokenness that made her the perfect guest to appear on Shannon Sharpe's Club Shay Shay this week, and as expected, the episode arrived with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">no shortage of interesting moments</a>. At one point in the interview, for example, Seales recalled one of her first-ever encounters with racism. She detailed the troubling experience, which saw her get bullied and harassed by a group of non-Black peers as a child during a trip to Walt Disney World.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-amanda-seales-on-club-shay-shay>Amanda Seales On Club Shay Shay</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Seales reflected on being called the N-word, being told she only got the opportunity because she's Black, and more, Sharpe chimed in. "They're kids," he said, leaving Seales in <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a state of disbelief</a>. "As a child, you never said anything derogatory? You were just this model citizen as a child?" She was quick to respond, making it clear that she was there to share her own experiences and how they've impacted her, and certainly not to defend her childhood bullies. "So you have no problem with the children that were cursing out Ruby Bridges?" she began. "And the Little Rock Nine?" Check out her full rebuttal above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Amanda Seales' recent appearance on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Club Shay Shay</a>?
