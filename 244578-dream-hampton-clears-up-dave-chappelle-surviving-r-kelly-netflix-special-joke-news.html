Kelly director Dream Hampton contacted him and asked if he would be involved with the Lifetime project. He said he turned her down but was surprised to hear his name being mentioned after the docuseries aired. "Dream’s promoting th<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">e sh*t and she keeps bringing me up.</a> She said, 'I asked Dave Chappelle to be in my documentary, and he said it was too hot for TV.' B*tch, I did not say that. That does not even sound like how I talk." Chappelle then mocked her by overexaggerating the word, "Too hot for TV."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She may have been the punchline to his joke, but Hampton took to Twitter to clear her name. "Quick fact check: I didn't personally (or casually) invite Chappelle to be interviewed for the doc," she wrote. "The producer responsible for celeb outreach officially asked him, more than once. I haven't seen or talked to him in about 8 years. Weird he told his joke that way." She also used his joke against him by saying, "I also have never in my life said the words 'too hot for tv', because, B*tch, that's not how I sound."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
