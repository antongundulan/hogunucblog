His uncanny ability to cook up a 21 st&nbsp;century “sauce” of genres transformed the multiplatinum Dallas, TX maverick into the “#1 Debut Hip-Hop Artist of 2016.” Upon release, <i>Stoney&nbsp;</i>bowed at #1 on the iTunes Overall Top Albums Chart and Top 10 on the&nbsp; <i>Billboard&nbsp;</i>Top 200. In just a few months, the debut album has accumulated over 4 billion streams globally. Setting the pace for alternative 21 st century Hip-Hop,&nbsp; <i>Stoney</i>’s unbeatable and unbreakable streak of smashes includes the breakout “White Iverson” (5x-platinum), his first Hot 100 Top 10 entry “Congratulations” [feat. Quavo] (6x-platinum), “Go Flex” (2x-platinum), “Too Young” (Platinum), “I Fall Apart” (Platinum), and “Déjà vu” [feat. Justin Bieber] (Platinum). Moreover, the multiplatinum Dallas maverick completed the&nbsp; <i>“longest climb ever to #1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart”</i>&nbsp;in history, breaking the previous record set in 1989, and topping the chart in its 51 st&nbsp;week of release being named “the #3 Overall Streaming Album of 2017.”</p><p><b><u>About 21 Savage:</u></b><br>Multiplatinum-certified rapper, artist, and visionary 21 Savage remains downright unstoppable. Recently, he teamed up with Post Malone for the platinum-certified mega-smash “rockstar,” achieving his first Billboard Hot 100 #1 in the process. Meanwhile, his full- length debut, Issa Album, stands out as one of the year’s biggest success stories. It clinched #2 on the Billboard Top 200 upon arrival, moving over 77,000 copies first-week. It also went #1 on the Apple Music Hip-Hop/Rap Chart. The lead single “Bank Account” earned an RIAA platinum certification and also peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. To date, Spotify streams exceed 216 million and YouTube/VEVO views surpass 64 million-plus.</p><p>Tearing through the game with tenacity, 21 Savage carved his own path to the top of 21st century hip-hop last year. Following a series of 2015 fan favorite mixtapes such as The Slaughter Tape and Slaughter King, he sent shockwaves through rap with the Savage Mode collaborative EP alongside super producer Metro Boomin. Not only did the project earn an RIAA gold certification, but it spawned the double-platinum “X” [feat. Future] and platinum “No Heart.” In between supporting Young Thug on tour and selling out his own headliner, 21 uncorked the platinum “Red Opps.” He changed the game with ISSA and Without Warning yet again.</p><p><b><u>About SOB x RBE:</u></b><br>With the entire West Coast riding for them SOB x RBE emerged onto the national hip hop radar in 2017, earning praise from publications like XXL who described their self-titled mixtape as “one of the best tapes of the year” and proclaimed that “SOB x RBE is the hardest rising crew in rap right now, bar none, and they’ve been on fire this year”. Meanwhile, Complex said the crew is “dominating the West Coast” and “making major noise in 2017” while the publication also featured “Anti” on their ‘Bout To Blow’ list.</p><p>There’s evidence to these claims as demonstrated by singles such as “Anti” (23 million views on YouTube), “Different” (17 million views on YouTube), and “Lane Changing” (8 Million views on YouTube) as well as a dozen other tracks that have eclipsed 1 million views each.</p><p>Now, with their debut album Gangin due out February 23rd and “Paramedic!”, their recent collaboration with Kendrick Lamar on Marvel’s Black Panther soundtrack, the group are proving that the early accolades are only the beginning of a long career.</p><p><b><u>About Live Nation Entertainment:</u></b><br>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Media & Sponsorship.
