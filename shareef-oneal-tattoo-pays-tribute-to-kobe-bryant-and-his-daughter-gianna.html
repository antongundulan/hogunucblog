The two superstars also had their struggles but managed to patch things up.</p><p>In Shaq’s emotional comments following Kobe’s death, he mentioned Shareef telling him, “Kobe just texted me” to see how he was doing, something Kobe used to do “from time to time.”</p><p>In a YouTube <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video report</a> from The Fumble, they discussed how Shareef missed the message that Kobe sent him. That message was regarding Shareef’s decision to transfer with Kobe asking, “You good fam?”</p><p>Shareef slept in and didn’t reply until later telling Kobe he was good and trying to figure out his next move.
