If you are a big ice cream fan, then you know exactly what to expect from this sort of colorway. Based on the photoshop rendering below, this could prove to be a hit.</p><p>Firstly, this shoe opens up with a predominantly white upper. From there, we have pink patent leather that wraps all the way around the shoe. Moreover, the Jumpman branding on the back appears to have some bronze stitching, which completes the Neapolitan aesthetic. Overall, Jumpman did a good job thinking this one through.</p><p>Women's exclusive colorways have been steadily improving over the years, and this is another example of that. Now, it will be up to the sneakerheads to decide whether or not they want to spend their hard-earned cash on these.</p><span><h2 id=h-release-rumors>Release Rumors</h2></span><p>At the time of writing this, the shoe does not yet have an official release date. However, more news should be available soon, so stay tuned to HNHH for more news and updates from around the sports world.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ4FxgpJmmKKqXZ%2B8s7DAp2RqaV2jsqK8zqWgrZmeYrCwucinnmasmJ7AbsXEmqlmnpmnwLV5y6impA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
