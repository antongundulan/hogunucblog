As of November, he is back designing for his namesake brand. (At the London premiere of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Michaela Coel wore a custom design from the line.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The fashion industry was riveted last September when Tisci announced his departure from Burberry —&nbsp;where he reignited the brand’s image, revived the Thomas Burberry Monogram and expanded the brand’s audience to a younger and more diverse crowd — after nearly five years. At the time, the brand’s CEO Jonathan Akeroyd said: “Riccardo has played a pivotal role in repositioning Burberry. He has enhanced our creative language, modernised and elevated our product offer and brought a new generation of luxury customers to our brand.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Said Tisci: “Burberry is a very special place with a magical past and a very promising future. I thrived to continue a legacy of innovation and consistently championed for creativity and diversity, in order to always keep Burberry moving forward.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2BntqSvwKubqGWknsCktYygoK%2Bdnpi1unnBrqmbnaKnxm7B05pkampjaoF6gZFtcGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
