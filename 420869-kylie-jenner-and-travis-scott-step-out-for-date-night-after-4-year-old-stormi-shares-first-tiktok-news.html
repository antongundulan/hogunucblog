The 31-year-old is in something of a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" position right now, as he's being&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">criticized for stopping his most recent concert</a> until eager fans climbed down from a lighting truss to safety.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you likely remember, late last year the "ESCAPE PLAN" artist hosted his annual Astroworld Festival, during which a crowd surge resulted in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">deaths of 10 attendees</a> and the injury and traumatization of hundreds more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Scott has maintained that he was unaware of the situation going on in the crowd or how severe it was, though attorney Alex Hilliard has spoken out against his actions at Coney Island, saying that it proves the Houston native "does know when to prioritize fan safety, but chose not to do that during [Astroworld]."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In response, a rep for the recording artist shot back, "It's beyond disappointing to see that - in a desperate bid to influence potential jurors â€“ plaintiffs' legal team is criticizing Travis for pausing Monday's Coney Island show to ensure that fans can have fun safely. This is exactly the wrong message to send to fans and to artists."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Scott has been having a tough time thanks to haters online, his oldest child, 4-year-old Stormi Webster, shared her first TikTok with the world via her mom's account, and it's already gotten over 3 million likes â€“ check it out below, and tap back in with&nbsp;HNHH later for more pop culture news updates.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">stormis first tik tok ðŸ¤£</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
