He said at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: "I certainly support No Smoking Day and, unlike in some previous years, I hope to meet its requirements in full."</p><p>He has said in the past: “When I was 14, 15, 16, I was doing things that teenagers do in terms of drinking too much, being caught having the odd fag, things like that.”</p><p>The Tory health minister <b>Simon Burns</b> has been described as a “chain-smoker”. Prior to the smoking ban being introduced in the UK he criticised plans to prevent smokers from lighting up in restaurants in the House of Commons in 1998 citing “the new nanny Labour army”.</p><p><b>Nick Clegg</b> told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in October last year that he was an occasional smoker, and selected as his castaway luxury a "stash" of cigarettes. He later joked on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show that the Prime Minister's success in quitting showed that there were differences between the two men.</p><p>Hinting that the arduous work of government had led him to sneak more cigarettes than usual, he ruled out quitting before the end of the Coalition's term of office in 2015. "The rate we're going... it will be up to 20 a day," he said.</p><p><b>Barack Obama</b> claims to have given up smoking after puffing on cigarettes for 30 years.</p><p>According to his wife Michelle Obama he quit after numerous failed attempts because he wants to be able to tell his daughters he does not smoke.</p><p>Mr Obama, 49, has admitted that he began smoking in his late teens, although his usage had dwindled to a few cigarettes a day by the time he launched his campaign for president in 2007.</p><p>One of Mrs Obama's conditions for agreeing to a bid for the White House was that her husband gave up smoking, but despite "chewing Nicorette strenuously" he confessed to regularly cadging cigarettes from campaign aides.</p><p><b>Ken Clarke</b>, the cigar-smoking justice secretary, was deputy chairman (1998-2007) of British American Tobacco and chairman of its corporate social responsibility audit committee. He is addicted to cheroots.</p><p>Cuban leader <b>Fidel Castro</b> - a cigar aficionado in the early days of his left-wing revolution - kicked the habit in 1986 for health reasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwtMSao62gX6OyuL%2BOcWpwaWZmhnCSwKamrqtdqLqwt8SrqmahnmK9sLjIraCcq16dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
