One night, there was supposed to be a heavy snowstorm and Winfrey, worried that King wouldn't be able to get home safely, offered to let her stay at her apartment for the night.</p><p>"We ended up talking all night long," Winfrey said. "We've literally been friends ever since." Like good friends do, Winfrey lent King a dress to wear to work the next day.&nbsp;In an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post promoting the interview, Oprah wrote, "Who knew a snowstorm 46 years ago would gift us a friendship of almost five decades?"</p><p>Well, the two 20-somethings probably didn't predict that one day they'd become two of the most powerful and influential people in television journalism and change the talk-show industry forever, either. Life can be funny that way. And fans are here for the reminiscing and their longtime bond, with Instagram comments ranging from "#bffgoals for sure" to "Friendships like these are a rarity in today's times."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWxnZYFze9OhnGatnprFsbHCrZydZZ%2Bntqi1zWamn2WXlsatsYyapZ1ln6W%2ForTSZp2roZWjsbS0yKlkn6GelrmtxYyrnK%2BdkaGypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
