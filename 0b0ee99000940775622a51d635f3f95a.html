If you step quickly it is also a great cardio workout,” explains Ben.</p><p>To get the best workout from a stepper machine, Ben recommends two different methods.</p><p>“If you are stepping at a moderate pace you will need to train longer to get results, so for 45-60 minutes. Or you can do interval training, where you go all-out for a minute (for example) and then reduce the intensity for 20 seconds. After 20 minutes of that you will feel a burn.”</p><h2 id=U811109309247Fv>STEPPER MACHINE VS STAIR CLIMBER MACHINE</h2><p>When deciding what sort of stepper machine to invest in, you’re going to want to think about your budget and how much space you have in your home.</p><p>Generally speaking, stepper machines are more affordable and easier to fit into your home. A stair climber machine is almost always more expensive.</p><p>Ben Lucas says “a stair climber will work you harder as it mimics real life, but it does take up a lot of space so you may be better off getting a stepper that you can use in front of the TV (for example), and then just walk or run up the steps to mimic a stair climber.”</p><p><b>More Excercise Coverage</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=bbd6605fb1945209bba13d89b858dfa5 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best exercise treadmills</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a3973d2cd0f7dee2ae6d395f5f53c8c7 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best exercise bikes</a></p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=4dac53936c24905b51bb5f1a269ec094 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best cross-trainers and elliptical machines</a></p><p>Looking for the best deals and sales?
