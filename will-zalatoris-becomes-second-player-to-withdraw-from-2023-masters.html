Ahead of the first men's Major of the year, he spoke about the root cause of his issues and the adjustments he's had to make.</p><p>"The genesis of it was actually bad right ankle mobility," Zalatoris said. "Because of me not pushing off my right side soon enough and being a very kind of dynamic player with some side bend, my right hip got high and tilted back.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've been trying to get me actually to stand closer to the golf ball, so that makes me create space with the ball so I can turn more horizontal as opposed to lateral. It's been good. It's taken its sweet time to get the full swing to come back, but I think really the last couple weeks we finally have seen some progress.</p><p>"Actually, my back doctor texted me this morning and he said, 'Hey, enjoy this week because this was the goal of coming back was to be back here, and you've played seven events. You're way ahead of schedule'.&nbsp;</p><p>"Results regardless, if you asked me in October, this was probably 50-50 me playing here, and the fact I played seven events showed that I did the right things. I've had no pain over the last month."</p><p>In that vein, Zalatoris was full of optimism ahead of his third Masters appearance, having finished second on debut in 2021 and tied for sixth last year.
