"Sir is very quiet," Tina noted, revealing that he gravitates more towards numbers than fashion.

"We’ve been part of that culture for a long time, and I was very excited about it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c23234899da-beyonce-jay-z-kids-7.jpg><p id=ey9p4Pz6icp data-wc=39>She described Cowboy Carter as a "nice history lesson" for fans, applauding Beyoncé’s ability to educate subtly through her music. "She has this way of doing things subtly but educating, and so I’m really proud of that," Tina shared.</p><p id=eu9OeHmTKyM data-wc=20>The release of Cowboy Carter was a strategic decision for Beyoncé, who adapted her plans due to the global climate.</p><p id=ejG0AWTPJKX data-wc=77>Originally intended to be released first, the album was postponed in favor of the more upbeat Renaissance. "It’s been really great to have the time and the grace to be able to take my time with it," Beyoncé told Variety. "I was initially going to put ‘Cowboy Carter’ out first, but with the pandemic, there was too much heaviness in the world. We wanted to dance. We deserved to dance. But I had to trust God’s timing."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
