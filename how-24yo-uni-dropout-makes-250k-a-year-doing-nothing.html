Stallon Zayya, 24, from Sydney, makes a significant amount of money from his positively-geared properties in Wollongong, southern NSW.
He also has a six-figure cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) portfolio as well as running a lucrative e-commerce business that has made him $10 million in sales. Mr Zayya’s entrepreneurial streak began in high school when a YouTube channel he created about gaming took off in 2014, netting him $4000 a month."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He poured around $250,000 into ethereum — although this would be worth substantially less now after the cryptocurrency crash.</p><p>He also bought an NFT valued at over $165,000 and sold a plot of land in Facebook’s virtual reality, Metaverse, for $150,000.</p><p>“It came to a time when I had over $1 million liquid just sitting there,” he said. “To me personally I hate dead money, I’d rather go through and invest it.”<br></p><p>With his fortune growing, Mr Zayya resolved to buy his first property.</p><p>“My goal is to have 10 properties by the age of 30,” Mr Zayya said.</p><p>He’s well on the way, with four under his belt already at the age of 24.</p><p>In April last year, he snapped up his first property, a Wollongong house for $1.3 million.</p><p>He had to pay a 20 per cent deposit but because of his massive fortune, it took just seven days for a bank to approve his home loan.</p><p>Then just two months later, in June, when Australia’s property craze was in full swing, Mr Zayya snapped up two more properties.</p><p>One was a similar price to his first purchase, at $1.31 million, and he also bought a block of units in an off-market deal for $1.55 million.</p><p>“I got renters in straight away, nothing stays not rented, at most five days,” he said, explaining they were all positively geared.</p><p>With property values across Australia increasing by an average of 25 per cent last year, Mr Zayya also experienced some windfalls after he got his homes re-evaluated by the bank.</p><p>His first house valued at $1.32 million rose to $1.72 million and the $1.31 million property is now worth $1.73 million.</p><p>His best investment was the $1.55 million block of units which ballooned to $2.1 million.</p><p>Using equity from those, he was able to buy his fourth property earlier this month, a block of two units for $1.275 million.</p><p>“It’s essentially a free property because of the equity,” he added.</p><p>“This brings total yearly rental income approximately all my properties to $258,000.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyzscClZJ6rpJbBpnvBrrCippdktbDDjGtrsqddqruqecOrpqmnpal6rq3KnqpmamVluG6tjLKcmqpdmbyqusZmpaismJ67qHvNnq6sZaOpvLPFjp1nbmllmIFzssJpbpxrkZaAp4LAaW2aa5Jshnh%2Fk2mc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
