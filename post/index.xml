No.1 瑞士最偉大的醫師所有人類文明都有永恆青春的夢想，但從沒有人如此接近它，直到保羅‧尼翰博士成功的壯大了這個偉大的夢想！早在1920年初期，保羅‧尼翰博士發現，活力的流失是導致衰老的重要關鍵，而產生清楚的願景—由生命之源注入活力，就能恢復青春光采。他的研究順利進展，在成功發表《Introduction to Cellular Therapy》後，於學術成就舉世聞名。並於1931年在瑞士萊蒙湖畔成立了抗老調養中心「活源保養之家」，以獨有的生命之源療法，打造令人驚豔的返齡賦活功效，當時這項前所未有的美麗創舉受惠了超過五千人造訪，他也因此被譽為瑞士最偉大的醫師。
拯救教宗的返齡聖殿位於瑞士萊蒙湖畔的La Prairie萊珀妮抗老調養中心，正是世家的發源地，La Prairie 的家徽logo正是它的形象。它有著獨一無二的絕美湖光山色，也因為與世隔絕形成隱密的調養勝地，僅有少數人知曉。但真正讓La Prairie萊珀妮抗老調養中心聲名大噪的，是在1954年2月的教宗急詔之後。教宗庇護十二世病情告急，緊急召喚保羅‧尼翰博士到梵蒂岡教廷救治，八週後教宗奇蹟般的康復。1955年，教宗庇護十二世正式授予保羅‧尼翰博士為梵蒂岡宗座科學院院士會籍，保羅‧尼翰博士從此聲名大噪，成為全球注目焦點。消息一出，許多王公貴族、明星藝人、藝術家蜂擁而至，前來瑞士度假並接受賦活返齡的生命之源療法，使得抗老調養中心成為上流人士欽點的返齡聖殿。
三座實驗室鎮守的配方隨著抗老調養中心成為返齡護膚聖地，來此造訪的顧客在體驗生命之源療法後，希望可以帶回保養品以維持功效，而無法親自來瑞士的人們，也期待可以透過保養品感受返齡奇肌。1978年，奢華保養品牌La Prairie萊珀妮應運而生，抗老調養中心的科學研發團隊傳承保羅‧尼翰博士生前珍貴的生命之源療法，結合全新的生物工程，打造明星級的「獨家植物萃取精華」，透過無數的臨床實證，讓人見證奇蹟般的返齡功效，珍貴的配方自1978年問世後至今未曾改變。特別的是，為了守護這項對抗歲月的秘密武器「獨家植物萃取精華」，除了將配方製程分屬於三座獨立實驗室，還立下互不聯繫的條款，至今沒有任何一名人員知道確切完整的配方。
活源療法的首款乳霜保羅‧尼翰博士開創了生命之源療法的抗衰老先河，打造橫跨逾半個世紀的抗老調養中心，在他1971年過世時，將當時累積獨特珍貴的返齡賦活醫學知識，宛如一座獨步全球的科研寶庫，傳承給後續主理抗老調養中心的醫師。他生前最後的研發計畫之一－製作肌膚外用乳霜，作為使返齡功效達到完美的最後一步，這項賓客離開調養中心時的餞別贈禮，也為後世預留肌膚終極返齡的美麗伏筆，後世科學研發團隊徹底實踐將此療法延伸至肌膚的計畫，實現保羅‧尼翰博士對於永恆的追求：「不只是賦予生命綿延的歲月，而是將肌膚活力的展現更增歲月風華。」理念。
保養藝術VS. 藝術滋養La Prairie如家徽般經典奢華的鈷藍色印記，源自一場命運般的邂逅！受到品牌創始人保羅·尼翰博士大膽無畏的創新精神鼓舞，La Prairie科學家從大自然汲取靈感，領先業界發現承載著最豐盛活性的珍貴魚子。
在此同時，藝術家妮基·桑法勒創造了藝術家本人同名香氛，當時與她合作的設計工作室，正好與 La Prairie萊珀妮共享設計空間。在她作品中經常可見以經典的鈷藍色，象徵女性氣質、大膽、力量和寧靜、優雅，恰好與「魚子美顏系列」的品牌精神不謀而合，於是妮基·桑法勒把如此特別的色彩引介給La Prairie，成為魚子美顏系列的關鍵人物，透過充滿生命力的鈷藍色與金黃色的魚子珍珠，完美詮釋La Prairie萊珀妮大膽無畏、頂級奢華的精神，而鈷藍色也成為La Prairie萊珀妮結合藝術與科學成就美麗的DNA。
La Prairie萊珀妮結合瑞士的純淨天然資源、頂尖科學工藝與藝術文化，引領全球尖端護膚權威，2022更斐然蛻變進化，抗老調養中心的原創字型是以流線型大寫字母構成優雅的標記。而今更從Helvetica Neue 中汲取靈感，原創標誌的字母從小寫變為全部大寫，賦予更強大的氣勢和地位，以全新的品牌識La Prairie萊珀妮，成就獨特、永恆、經典不朽的護膚傳奇。

The short answer is that you absolutely can. All materials vary in their ability to block the sun’s damaging rays from reaching your skin, and garments should not be depended upon to do this task.

Answer
Oil the roller bearings by pressing two to three droplets of oil into the front and rear of each roller bearing. Remove the dryer drum off the rollers and replace it on the rubber-rimmed rollers. Holding the drum with your knee is a good idea. Lift the spring above the motor and adjust the belt so that it is in the correct position.

Answer
Not only are Clorox Disinfecting Wipes easy to use, but they’re more hygienic too. Clorox Disinfecting Wipes dry clear and won’t leave behind a streaky residue, so you can use them with confidence on shiny surfaces, such as glass tables, mirrors, and metal fixtures.
Just so, can Lysol wipes be used on mirrors? It’s not clear from the question what type of mirror you have in mind, but if this is a photography question &amp;amp; you’re thinking about the mirror in your camera, then the answer is NO!</description></item><item><title>Charmed Trailer: Sisterhood</title><link>/charmed-trailer-sisterhood-1145814.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/charmed-trailer-sisterhood-1145814.html</guid><description>‘Charmed’ Trailer: “Sisterhood” Skip to main content Popular on THR Most Recent ‘Charmed’ premieres Sunday, October 14 at 9/8c on The CW. ad

「せきをする時は、体が病気の原因になるものを肺から押し上げようとしているのです」と言うのはマーシー・パーソナル・フィジシャンの一次診療医、ジェオン・ライアー医師だ。
とは言え、せきの根本にある原因は幅広く、それを正確に知ることが治療に役に立つ。
もっともよくあるせきのタイプせきの主なタイプや症状、治療についてまとめてみた。
空せき（痰を伴わないせき）せきについて：アメリカ疾病予防管理センター（CDC）によると、粘液や鬱血のないせきを通常「空せき」という。気道や喉、胸が痛む場合があるとライアー医師は説明する。
原因：喘息や咽頭炎、副鼻腔炎、胃食道逆流性症（GERD）、新型コロナウイルスなど、原因の可能性はさまざま。
治療法：「空せきの治療法は主に原因次第だ」とラトガース大学看護学校のエイリーン・M・ホームズ臨床准教授は言う。
また、ライアー医師は「喘息で空せきに苦しんでいる場合、現在の治療プランに微調整が必要かもしれないので、医師と相談しましょう」とアドバイス。
加えてCDCによると、ウイルス性の咽頭炎の場合はトローチを舐める、もしくは水分をたくさん摂るなど補助的治療をしながらウイルスが出るのを待つしかないという。もし、胃食道逆流症が疑われる場合は、胃の制酸薬を服用して様子を見ておくこと。
空せきは通常、肺が乾いて炎症を起こしているサインであるため、睡眠中は加湿器をかけて肺を鎮めることをライアー医師は勧める。
また、新型コロナウイルスの疑いがある場合は、自宅ですぐできる抗原検査かPCR検査を受けること。

せきについて：ホームズ准教授によると、粘液や、肺か喉の奥に鬱血があるので、「喀痰（かくたん）」とも呼ばれているという。
原因：「痰を伴うせきは、肺が感染症にかかっているサインとしてもっとも多いものです。肺炎や気管支炎、あるいは他の原因の可能性もあります」とライアー医師。
だが、必ずしも重度の感染症の兆候とは限らない。特に喘息や慢性閉塞性肺疾患（COPD）など肺の基礎疾患がある場合は、せき風邪でも痰を伴う可能性があるという。
治療法：ホームズ准教授は「症状の深刻度によって適切な治療法は異なります」と説明する。だが、透明な粘液が出てくるなら、感染症の可能性は少ないのだそう。
その場合は、症状に注意して、水をたくさん飲むかカフェインフリーのお茶に蜂蜜を入れて飲むなど補助的治療をするだけで大丈夫だ。
しかし、黄色または緑色の痰が出る場合は、抗生物質が必要かもしれないので、医師の診察を受けること。
コントロールできないせきせきについて：「発作性せき」と言われるもの。「せきが出始めるとずっと続くが何も出てきません。横隔膜がけいれんを起こすので非常に体力を消耗します」とホームズ准教授。
ライアー医師によると、せきがあまりに激しくて吐いてしまう人もいるという。
原因：百日せきの可能性が大いにあり、最近、大人によく見られるとカシアリ医師は言う。喘息や慢性閉塞性肺疾患、肺炎もこのせきの原因だ。
治療法：自分でなんとかしようとしても無理なせきだ。「医師に相談する必要があります。通常、市販薬で治るものではありません」とホームズ准教授は説明する。
犬吠様のせきせきについて：「非常に粗暴な音で痰を伴い、まるで犬やオットセイが吠えているように聞こえます」とライアー医師。
考えられる原因：咽頭から肺につながる気管が腫れているため、吠えているような音がするとホームズ准教授は言う。
また、ライアー医師は「呼吸器感染症の可能性がありますが、百日せきの典型的なサインでもあります」と説明する。
治療法：これも医師による治療が必要で、できるだけ早いほうがいい。「腫れが続いたり悪化させたくはないですよね」とホームズ准教授。

せきが3週間以上続く場合は、いつでも医師の診察を受けて欲しいとカシアリ医師は勧める。また、せきが日常生活に支障をきたしていると感じたり、せきと共に痰がたくさん出たり血液が出たりする場合は、なるべく早く病院に行くこと。

実際、毛穴の黒ずみ、角栓、にきび、嚢胞性ざ瘡は閉経期まで続く。だが、適切なにきび対策の製品を集中的に使い、一定のスキンケアルーティンを続けることで、よりクリアな肌を実現することは可能だ。
「私のところには毎日、にきびに悩む30代、40代、50代の方がやってきます」と言うのは、マウントサイナイ医科大学皮膚科准教授で『Skin Rules: Trade Secrets From a Top New York Dermatologist』の著者であるデブラ・ジャリマン医師だ。
「私は彼女たちに、必ず抑えることはできるけれど、エクササイズと同じで、日々決まったルーティンを続けることが大事だと言っています」
肌を徹底的にきれいにし、にきびを撃退できるというさまざまな製品が数限りなく出ている中、シンプルで効果のある対処法に絞り込むのは難しい。そこで、3人のトップ皮膚科医に解説してもらった。
にきびができる原因とは？皮膚には無数の小さな皮脂腺がある。それらは全身の毛包につながっていて、皮膚を保護するための皮脂を生成している。だが、いくつかの要因から、毛包から適切にその皮脂が逃げるのを阻害してしまう。
また、ホルモンは皮脂腺を過剰に働かせ、余分な皮脂が角質によってブロックされて毛穴を詰まらせ、にきびの原因になることも。レノックス・ヒル病院の皮膚科担当医でSobel Skinの創業者、ハワード・ソベル医師によると
、10代の場合、思春期の始まりにはたいていホルモンラッシュが始まるが、ホルモンによるにきびは大人にもよくあるという。
さらに、妊娠や月経周期、ピルを変えることで皮脂生成がスピードアップし、にきびができる。加えて、ストレスがたまると、体はコルチゾールを生成し、それが皮脂腺を刺激して吹き出物につながることも。
毛穴は炎症や、製品や生地（ハットやマスクなど）に対する反応によっても詰まるとソベル医師は説明する。中には、毛包の中に酵母菌がはびこることでにきびのような吹き出物ができることもある。
特に胸の上部や背中上部などがそうだ。コルチコステロイドなど特定の薬がにきびの原因になる場合もあるし、ジャリマン医師によると乳製品の食べすぎも原因になることもあるという。さらに、いったん毛穴が詰まってしまうと、次のようなさまざまなタイプのにきびを引き起こす。
ホワイトヘッド（角栓）肌色、もしくは白の小さなにきびが特徴。このタイプのにきびは、余分な皮脂と角質が毛穴の上のほうに詰まった時に出る。
ブラックヘッド（黒ずみ）ホワイトヘッドに似ているが、毛穴をつまらせているものが押し出され、空気に触れることで酸素と反応し、黒くなる。
にきび（ピンプル）毛穴の中に細菌が皮脂や角質と一緒に閉じ込められて炎症を起こし、赤いにきびとなって出てくる。
嚢胞性ざ瘡 硬く痛みを伴う吹き出物で、炎症を起こすと赤く隆起したり膿がたまったりする。 皮脂と角質、細菌が皮膚の奥深くに侵入して起こるという。

まずすべきなのは、いま肌（メイクも含め）と髪に使っている製品をすべてチェックすることだとジャリマン医師は言う。
「にきびケアのルーティンで犯している大きな間違いとしてよく見られるのは、多くの製品を使いすぎ、またラベルに書いてある原料をチェックしていないことです」
使っている製品に、オイリーでなく、にきびの原因になる成分が含まれていないことを示す“ノンコメドジェニック”や“ノンアクネジェニック”“オイルフリー”という言葉が書いてあるかどうか確認しよう。
それから、皮膚科医が推奨する次の6つのスキンケアルーティンを毎日続けて。
ステップ1：優しく洗顔するkazuma seki//Getty Images
まるでお気に入りのシューズについた泥を落とすように、顔を洗いたくなるかもしれない。だが、実はそれが症状を悪化させるとNYにあるSpring Street Dermatologyのエリジー・M・ラブ医師は言う。
「にきびは肌の余分な皮脂や汚れが原因だと信じている患者さんが多く、肌を過剰に洗ったり角質ケアしたりしようとします。クレンジングをルーティンにすることは重要ですが、にきびは炎症ですから、クレンジングしすぎると肌を刺激し、さらにその状態を進行させてしまうのです」とソベル医師。
「肌をむき出しにしすぎないことが重要です。肌を保護するバリア機能を損ない、さらなる吹き出物や炎症、赤み、ムラのある肌の質感やトーンにつながりますから」
今回、話を聞いた皮膚科医は3人とも、朝はマイルドなフォーミングクレンザーで洗顔することをすすめる。これに加えて、ほかの選択肢もある。
にきびのスポットケアをしたい人や医師ににきび用の薬を処方された場合は、朝はNeutrogenaの「Ultra Daily Face Wash for Sensitive Skin」などマイルドで薬用ではないクレンザーを使うこと。
もし、2つのステップを一緒にやりたい人は、にきびに対処する成分を含むフォーミングクレンザーを使うこともできる。角栓や毛穴の黒ずみが気になる人はサリチル酸を配合したクレンザーを使えば、ダメージを受けた皮膚の最上層をはぎ取り、毛穴に詰まる前に角質をキレイに落とすことができるという。
赤く炎症を起こしたにきびの場合は、表面の細菌をターゲットにした過酸化ベンゾイル配合のクレンザーを見つけよう（CeraVe Acne Foaming Cleanser には過酸化ベンゾイル、ナイアシンアミド、セラマイドが含まれており、ジャリマン医師は混合肌の人に勧める。もしくは過酸化ベンゾイルを10％配合したPanOxyl Foaming Washを試して）。
肌を洗浄する方法は、使用する製品と同じくらい重要だということにも注意。だから、ザラザラした素材のウォッシュクロスやスポンジ、刺激を与える素材のものは使わないこと。
ジャリマン医師はコットンパッドかベビー用ウォッシュクロスにクレンザーをつけて使うことを推奨するが、毎日清潔なウォッシュクロスを使って、古い汚れを肌にまた擦りつけてしまわないことが非常に重要だという。
手だけで、水を十分に使ってクレンザーを洗い流すこともできるとラブ医師は言う。だが、熱いお湯は肌を刺激するので、ぬるま湯だけを使うよう注意しよう。また、後で冷たい水で濡らすと、肌のバランスを整え、引き締め、リフレッシュすることができるとソベル医師は加える。
ステップ2：にきびに対処する薬を塗布するステップ1でシンプルなクレンザーを選んだ人は、よりパワフルな製品でスポットケアをするチャンスだ。顔を洗ったら、柔らかいタオルで、擦るのではなく、優しく叩くようにして（パッティング）乾かす。それからCeraVeの「Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Gel」や La Roche Posayの「Dual Action Acne Treatment」など市販の製品を使おう。</description></item><item><title> Golden Earring The Sad Story Of S</title><link>/the-sad-story-of-sam-stone-html.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-sad-story-of-sam-stone-html.html</guid><description>Sam Stone
