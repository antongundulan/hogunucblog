It's roughly an hour's drive away from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>the Waleses' family home in Windsor</a>; it's co-educational meaning that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Princess Charlotte</a> could also join her big brother George there when the time comes; plus, it has a very strong emphasis on community service, which are core to the royals' ethos.</p><p id=eRJvWakua0H data-wc=33>The school is headed by warden Alastair Chirnside, a University of Oxford graduate who was given a "congratulatory first" at graduation – a rare form of recognition for only the most brilliant students.&nbsp;</p><p id=e87zCNgFdW data-wc=70>His message on the school's website, in part, would chime with William and Kate's parenting ethos, as it reads: "There must be opportunity for all to take part and for all to excel. Children's happiness and their ability to recognise what will make them happy are more important than anything else. Teachers need not only to impart knowledge and to teach skills, but also to allow children to be themselves."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39661d6d4309-stedwardsoxford170058066532410279837855288968721854355.jpg><p id=eRYtW8pjVeA data-wc=31>I caught up with <strong>Melanie Sanderson</strong>, education consultant and managing editor of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">The Good Schools Guide</a>, who talked me through what would attract William and Kate to Teddies.</p><p id=e3US6x7S6ySE data-wc=63>"It's the million-dollar question," Melanie laughed. "I get asked this all the time. 'Where do I think William and Catherine will send the children?' When <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>it was just Marlborough College and Eton College on the table</a> (Kate and William's alma maters respectively), it all felt quite straightforward. But now all these other school names have been thrown into the mix, I don't know.</p><p id=ePp1J5zUHE9v data-wc=44>"I can see why Teddies would be a serious contender though. I can't name names but there are a few people who are loosely connected to the royal family at Teddies, so it's not as much of a rogue choice as it might appear.</p><p id=eKP5vY9Rsd-b data-wc=29>"Obviously, it's co-educational, and I think we're getting that strong message that William and Catherine want to educate their three children together, or they're certainly considering it very seriously."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Must read</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Heartbreaking reason Princess Kate left £28k-a-year all-girl boarding school" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f0fadfd40176-princess-kate-school-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Heartbreaking reason Princess Kate left £28k-a-year all-girl boarding school" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Heartbreaking reason Princess Kate left £28k-a-year all-girl boarding school</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/263d7bbe559f-gettyimages-808836104.jpg><p id=er5E2p_yllfS data-wc=38>While Kate's old boarding school Marlborough College was and still could be a possible option, there are reports that since the mother-of-three attended, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, it's become a bit too "flashy" for the Waleses' liking.&nbsp;</p><p id=e77CEpsF2yHa data-wc=64>"Teddies is very grounded, very understated," said Melanie. "It's classy, it's not bling, it's down-to-earth. It also has a very strong ethos of service and connection to the local community, which is core to what the royals do. We're told that William and Catherine are trying to educate their children to understand their privilege. And I think Teddies is very, very strong on that."</p><p id=er3mPLYk_s1Q data-wc=41><strong>We hope you enjoyed reading this small taster of our Royal Club post.
