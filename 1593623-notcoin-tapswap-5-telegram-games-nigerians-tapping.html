Man makes vital observation about Telegram coin mining app that has gone viral</span></p></a><h2>1. Defining Notcoin and Tapswap</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Binance</a>, Notcoin (NOT) is a token that started as a play-to-earn game on Telegram. The game offered players the chance to "mine" its digital <a href=#>currency</a> by engaging with an animated coin in the chat interface.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Tapswap is a fast-growing project in the decentralised finance sector that is also based on Telegram.</p><p class=align-left>On its<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> official X handle</a>, Tapswap disclosed that it is a Solana-based crypto exchange with low fees, high throughput, and exciting features like staking and margin trading. Players earn Tap tokens by engaging the Telegram Tapswap bot in a crypto-mining game.</p><h2>2. Tapswap has not been launched yet</h2><p class=align-left>The sudden rise in the popularity of the Tapswap has been attributed to the successful launch of the Notcoin.</p><p class=align-left>It was valued at $0.00568 per unit, giving it a market capitalisation of $574 million, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bitcoin News</a> reports. However, market prices are not stagnant.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4d73f1e7c23de27f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tapswap: Crypto geek shares 4 key reasons he won't invest in trending Telegram 'tapping' game</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Medium reports</a> that Tapswap will have its launch pool on May 30, 2024, and members will be able to exchange the in-game rewards for the real asset on the program "$TAPS Token".</p><h2>3. Notcoin can't be mined on Telegram anymore</h2><p class=align-left>The initial mining scheme of NOT officially ended on March 31, 2024, while Tapswap is still being mined on Telegram.</p><h2>4. Notcoin and Tapswap don't require expert knowledge</h2><p class=align-left>When it was still minable on Telegram, Notcoin offered players tokens via fun and simple tasks that do not require expert crypto knowledge.</p><p class=align-left>The same goes for Tapswap, which still gives players Tap tokens on Telegram after they complete simple tasks like joining groups or following X handles.</p><h2>5. Tapswap is projected to surpass Notcoin's performance</h2><p class=align-left>According to a crypto expert who spoke with <strong>Legit.ng</strong>, Obani Ebenezer Nwokoma, Tapswap has great potential and would likely surpass the performance of Notcoin when it is eventually launched. In his words:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2fae0f861f5a2fea.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tapswap: Man gives up, puts his account up for sale and shares total coins he mined on Telegram</span></p></a>"Tapswap is a good project with lots of promising potential. If you ask me, I see a possibility of Tapswap doing better than Notcoin because of the blockchain involved, known as Solana. Solana has more value than Ton, and its popularity was before Ton rose to fame this year."The thing is, the more popular a coin, the more chances of it doing well."<h2>Lady buys mum phone with Notcoin earning</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng </strong>previously reported that a lady bought her mother a smartphone with her <a href=#>earnings from Notcoin</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Since listing on major exchanges like <a href=#>Binance</a> and OKX, the viral Telegram Tap-to-Earn game has rewarded many of its players.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Nasdaq</a>, Notcoin (NOT) is a game embedded in Telegram that has recently attracted millions of players.
