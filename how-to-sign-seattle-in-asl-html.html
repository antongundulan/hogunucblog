agreed-upon sign for "Seattle" in ASL,</span><span> which adds a bit of fun to the whole thing.</span><span> But the most common method involves forming the letter "S" with your dominant hand and giving it a little shake,</span><span> like you're trying to dislodge a stubborn raindrop clinging to your fingertip.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:98><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong><span> Channel your inner rockstar.</span><span> Imagine you're signing a guitar solo for Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit.</span><span>" Just hold the intensity for a hair less and focus on that "S.</span><span>"</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:64>Location, Location, Location: When to Bust Out Your Shaky S</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:125><span>Now,</span><span> you might be

City.</span><span> Bonus points for a wink and a knowing smile.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=16:1-16:286><strong>Ordering a coffee:</strong><span> You know that barista probably gets "grande caramel macchiato" a million times a day.</span><span> Spice things up with a Shaky S after you order.</span><span> Maybe you'll get a conversation starter,</span><span> or at least a slightly bewildered look (which is basically the same thing in Seattle).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=17:1-18:0><strong>Pointing out a particularly impressive ferry:</strong><span> Because honestly,</span><span> those things are majestic.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:2><strong>Remember:</strong><span> ASL is a nuanced language,</span><span> and facial expressions play a big role.</span><span> So,</span><span>

the wrist.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=30:1-30:125><strong>Is there another sign for Seattle?</strong><span> Yep!</span><span> You can fingerspell S-E-A-T-T-L-E,</span><span> but the Shaky S is way cooler (and faster).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=31:1-31:18><strong>When should I NOT use the Shaky S?</strong><span> Probably during a super formal meeting.</span><span> Stick to fingerspelling there.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=32:1-32:107><strong>Will people understand my Shaky S?</strong><span> Most ASL signers will,</span><span> especially if you're in the Seattle area.</span></li><li
