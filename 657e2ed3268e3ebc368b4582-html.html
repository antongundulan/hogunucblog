We are talking about American <strong>Colby Covington</strong>, the welterweight who is challenging <strong><a href=#>Leon Edwards</a></strong> for the belt. Colby started his career as a wrestler as an All-American at Oregon State University. On February 2012, Covington made his MMA debut and has built himself a decent career ever since. <strong>UFC President Dana White</strong> famously was about to cut him when Covington had the idea to become a heel, like in WWE. The plan was to become a Donald Trump fan who happened to fight in the UFC and his wager paid off in a major way.</p><p>Since then, Colby Covington's prestige rose to the very top and has maintained that persona ever since. In 2018, he won the UFC Welterweight Interim Championship but ended up losing the actual title against Kamaru. Although he still hasn't made as much as many of the other UFC stars, Covington is making decent money that keeps food on his table and a comfortable life. Should he manage to defeat Leon Edwards later on Saturday, Covington will take that next step towards making multiple times of what he earns today. All he needs to do is remain as competitive as he was in his last three fights, that will give him a chance to win.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>How much does Colby Covington make per fight?</h2><p>In total, Covington's MMA recorded fight earnings reach $3,617,000 but they round to an estmated $4 million net worth. His biggest payout to date was $580,000 in his defeat against Kamaru Usman at UFC 245. Per fight, Covington currently earns around $1 million between his base salary, his win and performance bonuses, and his sponsorship. For the fight against Leon Edwards, Covington is projected to win an estimated $1.3 million between eevrything combined.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tcWMp5ytZaekv7W0jmtna2tfZn9wfZZobW5vlWeypX%2BRb2%2Bea5WXsHSCl5trbnBiY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
