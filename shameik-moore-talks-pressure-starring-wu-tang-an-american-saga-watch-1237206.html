You know, that was my concern on paper for me and my team. It was like, how does this differ? But it is a totally different story, it’s a different time, the approach is different, it’s gritty all the way through.”</p><p>“This person that exists, how he walks, how he talks, how he laughs, how he looks when he gets mad, how he sounds when he raps, how he eats food, that’s what I’m doing. And the decision that he made in the actual story,” he continued. “So the pressure is there for me, for sure. That was the biggest thing. That is my audition to myself, to the world. Because this ain’t Shameik, this is somebody else. Can he make me believe that he’s Raekwon?”</p><p>Moore also discussed the success of Wu-Tang Clan and why they’re a group that can’t be duplicated in music, saying, “They just stuck to the script, they never sold out. They were unique especially for the time. Entertaining and inspiring people, that’s what Wu-Tang became.”</p><p>He continued: “They were the most unlikely situation to become a success story out of America, which is why they call it Wu-Tang: An American Saga.”</p><p>Wu-Tang: An American Saga is now streaming on Hulu.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrJ%2BapZWeuG65zqipnmWklrmsv4ypqZ6ro6q%2FpnnSrZirqpmjtG7D1GarmqaXYq6vecCmnKuhk5a7br%2FAoJhmr5GpsKl5kGtqcGpga3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
