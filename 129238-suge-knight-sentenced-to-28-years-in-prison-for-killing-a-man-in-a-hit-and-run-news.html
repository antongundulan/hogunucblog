The incident that led to Carter's death occurred&nbsp;in 2015 during a confrontation between Suge and longtime rival, Cle "Bone" Sloan, a consultant on "Straight Outta Compton." Suge is said to have been fighting&nbsp;Sloan outside of a Compton burger stand through the window of his car when he decided to strike him with his vehicle before running over Carter.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">KTLA 5</a>, Suge&nbsp;appeared unfazed throughout the entire hearing. His face did not betray any emotion even when Carter's family members addressed the court with descriptions of Carter's kind and loving nature. Knight remained unmoved when Carter's daughter, Crystal, called him "a disgusting, selfish disgrace to the human species." Knight was ultimately&nbsp;charged with voluntary manslaughter.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In most cases,&nbsp;voluntary manslaughter charges result in 11-year&nbsp;sentences. Given Suge Knights' previous&nbsp;felony convictions, however, he is receiving a much lengthier sentencing. His combined discretions make him subject to California's three strikes law. The law dictates that in a situation such as Knight's, a manslaughter sentence is doubled and&nbsp;combined with an extra six years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZ4Zzf5dmqq6flWK4r7XGoatmq5Wjwaa6wp6bZqyfYn95ediemKurXZ67brzRoqqopl2bvLN5yqKjpaGenHqiecyapWahnmKubrTIrWSappRiv7a6jKecsKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
