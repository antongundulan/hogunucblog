There’s a reason why people make a big deal over the roughly 30-minute concert; it’s headlined by a big star, and while the performances are objectively dynamic, what the talent wears is also worthy of your attention.

Her crimson boilersuit and coordinated breastplate, designed by Jonathan Anderson, took our breath away. The same goes for her second look: an Alaia puffer coat and gloves.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jennifer-lopez-2020></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jennifer Lopez (2020)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">J.Lo and Shakira proved to be the dynamic duo fans were anticipating for the Super Bowl LIV Halftime Show, but it was Mrs. Affleck’s Versace catsuit that really captured our attention. The silver-embellished one-piece was a show stopper, indeed, and was flawlessly accessorized with matching fingerless gloves and a pair of strappy stilettos.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lady-gaga-2017></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lady Gaga (2017)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We went *gaga* over this halftime show fashion moment from Mother Monster. The two-piece ensemble consisted of bedazzled hot pants (courtesy of Swarovski) and a cropped, white leather jacket inspired by a football player’s jersey and shoulder padding — which, yes, was also enhanced with a sprinkle of sparkle.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beyonce-2016></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Beyonce (2016)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyonce was giving Michael Jackson for her 2016 Super Bowl Halftime performance. In an exclusive interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Essence</a>, the “Cuff It” singer’s stylist, Marni Senofonte, told the site that Beyonce “wanted to pay homage to Michael” as “he is her biggest music influence and Michael’s halftime performance marked a change in global interest for the halftime show.” The iconic look included a cropped black leather jacket and gold harness (both of which were designed by DSquared2) that were worn over a sleek black bodysuit designed by Ashton Michael. The superstar also stepped onto the field in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-katy-perry-2015></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Katy Perry (2015)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Katy Perry was a literal firework during her halftime show at Super Bowl XLIX. For her finale, the American Idol judge was lifted into the sky wearing a star-studded, silver gown with a leg slit as dramatic as the performance. The dress was designed by Jeremy Scott and sparkled in the sky as she soared over the stadium.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nicki-minaj-2012></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nicki Minaj (2012)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Nicki Minaj joined Madonna on the Super Bowl Halftime stage back in 2012, the rapper stunned from her Erickson Beamon headpiece to her black and gold, custom-made, knee-high Giuseppe Zanotti boots. Minaj’s red and black color-blocked mini dress was designed by Fausto Puglisi. The halftime fashion moment was a play on a cheerleading uniform only with a slightly tougher exterior, featuring studs and a belt under the bust with the letter “N” at its center.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shania-twain-2003></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shania Twain (2003)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two words: Show stopper. Shania Twain was feeling more than alright the night she headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2003. The country sensation strutted up and down the stage in a bedazzled bra top that shone as brightly as her chandelier earrings and the choker that dripped diamonds down her neck. Naturally, Twain paired her ultra-cropped top with a short skirt, completing the halftime fashion moment with over-the-knee boots and a matching black trench coat.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gwen-stefani-2003></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gwen Stefani (2003)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2003, Gwen Stefani took to the Super Bowl Halftime stage like the true '90s alternative punk rock star she is: in a pair of low-rise cargo pants (neatly tucked into combat boots), her underwear peeking out along the waistband, and a glitter-packed, halter bralette top layered over a red bra. Accessories included fingerless leather gloves, a studded belt, and the singer’s famously defined abs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gloria-estefan-1999></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gloria Estefan (1999)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The crowd got loud when Gloria Estefan took the stage for the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 1999, but her vocals weren’t the only part of the performance that deserved a standing ovation. The Father of the Bride actress’ ensemble was fitting for the time and coming back around now: A corset-style top paired with a maxi skirt riddled with fringe detailing. It just goes to show, in fashion especially, what goes around comes back around.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-queen-latifah-1998></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Queen Latifah (1998)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bow down. Queen Latifah looked like pure royalty for her Super Bowl Halftime fashion moment in 1998, when she took the stage dressed in a jacket outfit that would slay even today. The rapper popped the collar of her floor-length, paisley-printed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>duster coat</a> and clasped two buttons at its center, leaving it open to reveal the black bustier she wore underneath. Accessories were kept simple — a diamond necklace around her neck — but let’s be honest, Queen Latifah doesn’t need added sparkle to shine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-diana-ross-1996></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Diana Ross (1996)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of, if not the most iconic Super Bowl Halftime fashion moments came courtesy of Diana Ross. In the 12 minutes that the performer was on stage, she had multiple wardrobe changes, but a personal favorite is this orange and purple gown that made a statement as only Ross could.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6qrWWjqr2mvoybprCkXZ2urbLToqSeZZaWwKm1zqdkpqedmru1v4xwaGltZ2WC</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
