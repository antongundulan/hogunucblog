The Irish Sun reports that when Pope Francis visited Ireland in 2018, he blessed 500 engaged and married couples in Dublin's Pro Cathedral."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Three lucky couples even got to meet him. That's when dairy farmer Denis Nulty — incidentally, the nephew of a bishop — told the pope that he was prepared to commit to "sacrifice of marriage." Of course, he meant to say "sacrament." Talk about Freudian slips. Nulty said afterwards, "It was just the pressure. Nerves. I don't know where the word sacrifice came from. I knew I was going to miss up at some stage though! It was a slip of the tongue."</p><p>But Pope Francis, especially, understands how embarrassing mixing up your words at important moments can be, because early on he had a pretty classic mistake of his own. Less than a year into his papacy, while speaking to the faithful in St. Peter's Square, he mixed up the Italian words "caso" and "cazzo." He's not a native Italian speaker, so no big deal? Well, the first one means "example," but the second has various translations,&nbsp;<a href=#>according to NPR</a>, including "a vulgar term for 'penis'" and "f***," all of them inappropriate for a pope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlHJvam5fqbWmecGinqCdo6l6rrXSrZiknaNivaa7z6WcZqWRoLJuw8eepWallZrBqrrGZquhnV2lvLGxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
