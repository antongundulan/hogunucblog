At the time, WWE issued a statement denying any wrongdoing.</p><p>Now, John Laurinaitis is the latest to issue a statement responding to Ashley’s allegations. The former WWE executive’s lawyer Edward Brennan issued a statement to Vice.com denying that he covered up her rape allegations. The statement further claimed that WWE followed all the protocols that were in place at the time.</p><p>“Any allegations that Mr. Laurinaitis helped to cover up an alleged rape allegation is an outright lie. Johnny, like most upper level management at sometime became aware of the allegations and ensured all proper WWE protocols were followed, including privacy for the alleged victim. We object to the use of the term cover up as no such plan or plot ever took place to hide or assist in the alleged rape.”</p><p><a href=#>Laurinaitis was fired from WWE</a> in 2022 after initial sexual misconduct claims came to light against him and Vince McMahon. He was replaced by Bruce Prichard. Stay tuned to <a href=#>Ringside News</a> as we continue to stay on this story.</p><p>What do you think about John Laurinaitis’ statement?
