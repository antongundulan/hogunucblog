Her ability to translate her own old-Hollywood aesthetic onto the modern-day red carpet earned her a legion of fans, the role of spokeswoman for eBay Fashion in 2010 and recognition as one of <a href=#>THR‘s 25 Most Powerful Stylists in Hollywood in 2011</a>. Tollman also had a show in creative development with Bravo. Her loss is being felt throughout the industry.</p><p class=p1>“Annabel was one of those people who just made life better,” adds <strong>Andrew Saffir</strong>, founder of film marketing firm The Cinema Society and a close friend of Tollman. “Every party, every dinner, every gathering was better when she was in the mix. Funny, gorgeous, stylish (obviously), and so much fun, with a knowing and charming and sometimes naughty&nbsp;twinkle in her eyes. Every fashion party and glittery gathering will now be missing her special spark.”</p><p class=p1>In addition to appearing on THR‘s&nbsp;inaugural 25 Most Powerful Stylists in Hollywood List, Tollman also worked with the magazine on a May 18, 2012, cover and photo spread featuring <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_marion-cotillard data-tag=marion-cotillard>Marion Cotillard</a></strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=p1><strong>Michael Flutie</strong>, who managed Tollman’s styling and budding on-camera career for the past seven years, tells THR he and the stylist had just wrapped a pilot — called Style Friends — for presentation to TV networks.</p><p>“She was able to really articulate her passion for clothes. Everything on camera was so magical,” Flutie recalled. “I’m going to miss her fine taste for champagne and Laduree macarons as much as the conversations about what the (fashion) industry is about.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKK6zZqZnqRdqbytuMyapWacmZrAbq3TZmpyZWVrgXl%2Bl2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
