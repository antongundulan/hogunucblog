 The Byrds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and the five original members performed together for the final time on that occasion. Michael Clarke died of liver failure in 1993, while Gene Clark died of a heart attack later that year. McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman are still alive and well.
 Who was in the Byrds in 1965, in this case? The original members of the band — guitarists Roger McGuinn and David Crosby, singer Gene Clark, bassist Chris Hillman, and drummer Michael Clarke — went on to form influential bands like Crosby, Stills, and Nash and the Flying Burrito Brothers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
