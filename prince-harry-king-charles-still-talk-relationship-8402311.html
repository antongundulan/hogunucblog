According to royal expert Omid Scobie, who is currently promoting his new book, Endgame, there's still a "warmth" between the father-and-son duo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A striking difference between Charles and William when it comes to their relationships with Harry there is still a warmth with Harry and Charles,” Scobie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. “With Harry, there’s a reluctant acceptance that this is just who his father is.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scobie added that Harry is typically the one who initiates communication, but his wife, Meghan Markle, also still talks to the king. “He would rather have that in his life than to cut it off completely. Hence, when they talk, it is often [Harry] reaching out," Scobie explained. "And I was surprised to learn that even&nbsp;Meghan [Markle]&nbsp;has some sort of correspondence with Charles, sending over photos of the children [Prince Archie, 4, and&nbsp;Princess Lilibet, 2], although they’re not directly to him. So, there is a willingness there.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though the two are on speaking terms with the his royal highness, Harry and Meghan were seemingly not invited to his 75th birthday celebrations this week. However, People notes that they did call Charles to wish him a happy birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the news was officially reported that Harry would not be joining in the festivities, The Sunday Times stated that the duke would "not making the trip from California." A rep for the Sussexes dispelled the article by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>releasing a statement</a> that read, "In response to U.K. media headlines, there has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday.
