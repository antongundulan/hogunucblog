According to Insider, cowboys, Popeye, Tinkerbell, Mickey Mouse, and superheroes (per CNN) were widespread in the 1950s. In the '60s, The Addams Family and Barbie were big, Star Wars characters took over the '70s, and E.T. and gory figures dominated the '80s. The '90s, meanwhile, were all about brand-name products like McDonald's fries and Tootsie Rolls.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>By the end of the 20th century, Halloween night was a hodgepodge of bloody corpses, princesses, scary clowns, superheroes, walking M&Ms, pirates, bedsheet ghosts, and adorable animals vying for candy or first prize in a costume contest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j25qcGlgZMSprdNmn5qknKTEprHNZq6aq12htqyxjKKlZmpgqbVur8Snq66qqWKurrHRopqaZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
