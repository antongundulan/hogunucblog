By Nathan Kamal | Updated 1 year ago It is always fun to find out that glamorous, beautiful celebrities are just as much of pop culture nerds as the rest of us. In this particular case, Mad Men and X-Men star January Jones posted a picture of herself on Instagram with a very … interesting haircut and commented how much it resembled that of Stranger Things star Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) when he attended the Snow Ball at the end of Season 2."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In this particular case, Mad Men and <a href=#>X-Men</a> star January Jones posted a picture of herself on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with a very … interesting haircut and commented how much it resembled that of <a href=#>Stranger Things</a> star Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) when he attended the Snow Ball at the end of Season 2. As you can see from the social media image below, the resemblance is striking.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dustin-stranger-things-gaten-matarazzo-1254638-900x506.jpg><p>While both January Jones and Gaten Matarazzo are known for perfectly embodying the spirit of decades past, they are not known for the same time periods. January Jones rose to widespread fame and critical acclaim for portraying 1960s dissatisfied housewife Betty Draper in the AMC drama Mad Men, while Gaten Matarazzo is prime nerd material on the 1980s-set blockbuster series Stranger Things on Netflix. However, it seems there is plenty of crossover between the two when it comes to tightly coifed, poodle-curly hairstyles.</p><p>It seems January Jones is a considerate person, as she took the time to tag Gaten Matarazzo in the Instagram post, presumably so he can judge for himself whether she imitated his New Romantic-style hairdo sufficiently well. She also tagged her team of experts in the photo, including her wardrobe stylist Samantha McMillen, makeup artist Sam Boutros, and hairstylist Jean Claude El Moughayar (who presumably takes either the credit or blame for this one).&nbsp;</p><p>January Jones is wearing an outfit by Rodarte (though little of the actual gown can be seen in these pictures) and jewelry by Delfina Delettrez. Jones seems to like the more out-there designers, given her penchant for wearing outre, comic book-style dresses like <a href=#>this one</a>, though she will also take time out for a simple and sexy pink bikini like <a href=#>this one</a>. January Jones began her career as a model (much like her character Betty Draper), posing for brands like Abercrombie & Fitch and Versace, and has appeared on the covers of Allure, Cosmopolitan, and Harper’s Bazaar.</p><p>In short, we are saying that January Jones knows more than a little bit about fashion. So, if she wants to take on perhaps the single oddest hairstyle from Stranger Things (we’re including Millie Bobby Brown’s various looks), we believe that she can turn it into something stylish.&nbsp;</p><p>It has been some time since January Jones appeared in a superhero movie, last appearing in 2011’s X-Men: First Class reboot along with James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Kevin Bacon. So far, that has been the only live-action appearance of January Jones as Emma Frost, aka the White Queen, whose powers include both psychic abilities to rival Professor Charles Xavier and the ability to turn her body into impenetrable crystal.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that the Marvel Cinematic Universe seems <a href=#>eager</a> to bring as many X-Men actors of the past into play, it would not be at all surprising if we see January Jones back in action as a mutant. For now, we at least get to see her as a different kind of oddball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmpa7tq3RsmSjp56awG6%2F06uYp5%2BVp3q1tMinnqxlmJa2s6%2FUrWWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
