* Cheung Wai, A Chinese Miner Who Was Trapped Underground For 17 Years
Wai and 78 other co-workers were trapped underground after the 1997 magnitude 7.8 earthquake that hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse some large sections of the tunnels."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The former record for surviving underground was 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith, who buried himself in the backyard of the Railway Inn with the intention of breaking a world record.&nbsp;</p><p>Mining accidents have killed over 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium, but the country's government has put in place measures to curb the disaster as they have been clamping down on unregulated mining operations, which account for almost 80 percent of the country’s 16,000 mines.&nbsp;</p><p>According to government statistics, the shutting down of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year has reduced the numbers of miners killed in a day to six in the first months of this year.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3d%2Fl2xloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
