While we’ll have to wait and see the performance & cyphers, we did get a glimpse at some of our favorite artists walking onto the red carpet as photos started surfacing online Friday night. Many artists & rappers were decked to the nine looking dapper, including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dave East</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Khaled</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Yachty</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a>, & others, but it was Florida’s own XXXTentacion who appears to have made the loudest statement.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>With his girlfriend by his side, XXXTentacion decided to wear a half-black, half-white mask while walking the red carpet, presumably trying to make a statement of sorts. He also was spotted with his Nintendo Switch too in his hand, which is a portable gaming device. So it looks like X wasn't taking his appearance too seriously to say the least.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>X not only attended the award show, but he’s also rumored to be participating in the cypher as well, which will find him rocking the mask once again. It appears he wore the mask the entire night too, and not just on the red carpet.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>Looking like he’s ready for a 2017 Purge, check out XXXTentacion’s appearance at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards (below). Are you feeling it or do you think it's ridiculous?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>In other related news, XXXTentacion just shared a clip on Instagram the other day&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">previewing an upcoming new song</a> that's on the way. He captioned the post with “Soon,” so keep your eyes peeled for that in the coming days. Who knows maybe we’ll get the record following Tuesday’s airing of the Award Show?</span></p><br><h2>XXXTENTACION</h2><p>About The Author</p><p>Kevin Goddard is an editor for HNHH.
