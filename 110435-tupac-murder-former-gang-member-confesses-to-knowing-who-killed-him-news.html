With so many interpretations and conspiracy theories about what happened, it seems that the only person alive that may actually be able to piece things together is ready to speak out. With so much life left to live, Pac was murdered at the age of 25 in a drive-by shooting. New details are breaking out from that fateful night in 1996 and much of it has to do with the crew behind the USA Network's&nbsp;Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Notorious B.I.G.</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the prime suspects in the case has always been Orlando Anderson and it appears as though things will be cleared up very soon. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Esquire</a>, a former gangster named&nbsp;Duane Keith “Keffe D” Davis has confessed that he knows who killed Tupac but he won't fess up because&nbsp;of the "street code." Davis is Orlando Anderson's uncle and he is claiming that shots came from the backseat of the car he was in. Over twenty years is a long time to keep a secret but Unsolved&nbsp;looks to feature Davis' confession under immunity of prosecution. The gang member said, "I was a Compton kingpin, drug dealer, I’m the only one alive who can really tell you the story about the Tupac killing.&nbsp;People have been pursuing me for 20 years, I’m coming out now because I have cancer, and I have nothing else to lose. All I care about now is the truth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZn11f5Rmq66okZh6rsHRnZyrZZakv66x0WaemqaXYrqmucGeqWabn6Ozpr%2FSnqpmrJ9iuK%2B71qKloGWnnbxut8ilo56cXZ22rnnNnq6s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
