The two share a son together, who they continue to raise amicably. However, he has since moved on with Taina Williams, who he now <a href=# rel>shares two children</a> with.</p><p>During their chat, Miami pressed the Survivor's Remorse artist for more details on his romantic past. Specifically, she wanted to know if he considers himself a "cheater."</p><p>While he doesn't engage in such antics right now, Herbo admitted to being unfaithful towards Fletcher with Williams near the end of their relationship. "I was young, I was dumb. I ain’t know no better, man, I was just doin’ shit," he explained of his toxic decision.</p><p>"Me and her was having our differences, but that was no excuse to cheat on her," the Chicago native added. In the weeks since then, his ex obviously got wind of the situation. Now, she's finally sharing some of her own thoughts on her past love with the world.</p><p>"I'm not gonna lie, I kind of always wanted him to be upfront and honest. I always felt like it was just me fighting against all of these people, trying to 'tell my truth,'" she explained during a recent online interview.</p><p>Fletcher went on, "Now at this point, I don't really care. Back then, I would've loved that. Take this weight up off my shoulders, tell these people that I'm not trippin'."</p><p>Watch the full episode of Caresha Please with Yung Miami and <a href=# class=text-word rel>G Herbo</a> below.
