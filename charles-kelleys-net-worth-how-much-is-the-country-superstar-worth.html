The singer told <a href=#>The Boot</a> in July 2016 that when he first moved to Nashville, he was broke but was able to crash at his brother's house. "He let me stay at his place for a year, rent-free, living like kings," Kelley said. "Without him, I don't think I would have done it."</p><p dir=ltr>While he was a struggling artist, Kelley worked construction to put some money together. Once he and Dave Haywood teamed up with Hillary Scott to form Lady A, they had to make the choice to quit their day jobs. "Dave really took a leap of faith," he told The Boot. "For me, I wasn't making anything; I was making minimum wage, working for my older brother. Dave had a really good job."</p><p dir=ltr>The risk seemingly paid off in spades considering the fact that, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kelley has a net worth of $25 million. With all that money in the bank, in 2012, the singer was able to purchase a 6,600 square-foot home for $1.6 million, and ended up selling it for $2.9 million in 2017, per <a href=#>Architectural Daily</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2016, Kelley released Driver, a solo album. He told the <a href=#>Tennessean</a> that financial freedom allowed him to pursue this passion project. "I've gotten to the point where I've made enough money that I don't care about the money anymore," the singer said. "I've got to start doing things that I want to do."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBhaoJze8KhmKuklah6rLHLpZyyq12jsrV51qipraBdnby4ecyumqFlmah6tbTEZpqorZ6pv7p50q6nnqqjqa6zedaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
