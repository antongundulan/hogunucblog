The story of his conception and birth begins with the aftermath of an event called Ultimatum, which is also considered to be one of the worst event comics ever.<h2>Who did Thor get pregnant?</h2>Hela agreed to release him under two conditions. The first was that she wanted an heir, so the two had sex and Thor impregnated her.

In the comics, the Mad Titan once had a romance with Hela, the Goddess of Death and ruler of Hel.<h2>Does Thor have a daughter?</h2>Þrúðr (Old Norse: [ˈθruːðz̠], "strength"), sometimes anglicized as Thrúd or Thrud, is a daughter of the major god Thor and the goddess Sif in Norse mythology.<h2>Does Thanos have a wife?</h2>They were subsequently greeted by Thanos' future self, who sported the same clothes Frank used as the Punisher. He brought both of them to his future, showing Frank the authoritarian world he had built on his example, including a past version of himself living with his wife Maria.<h2>Who is Thor's true love?</h2>Jane is Thor's love interest. She is an astrophysicist. Jane appeared in most Thor micro-episodes and in the films.<h2>How many wives did Thor have?</h2>He defended her on several occasions. Thor was married twice: first to Iarnsaxa and second to Sif. He had 3 sons and 1 daughter from these 2 marriages.<h2>Who is Loki's wife?</h2>Loki is married to Sigyn and they have two sons, Narfi and Nari or Váli. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. In the form of a mare, Loki was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.<h2>Who is Thanos girlfriend?</h2>Having defeated the Black Order, the hooded figure reveals herself to be none other than Hela, former ruler of Hel, the Asgardians underworld. Hela promises that she give him something he desires even more than a hammer or the Infinity Gems, and that's death. The two villains then share a kiss.<h2>Is Hela Loki's daughter or sister?</h2>In Marvel's comic book mythology, Hela is Thor's niece, being the daughter of Loki, or a Loki, at least; it gets complicated, in that Loki has been resurrected on a number of occasions.<h2>Is Hela and Lady Death the same?</h2>Hela is an Asgardian, same as Thor and Odin. Death, also known as Mistress or Lady Death, is a completely separate entity - a cosmic entity that is the personification of death, come to collect the souls of those who have died.<h2>Who is Captain America's son?</h2>A character named James Rogers appears in Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow, voiced by Noah Crawford. The character is the son of Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Black Widow (Natasha Romanova).<h2>Who is Captain America's daughter?</h2>Sarah Rogers was the daughter of Steve Rogers, Captain America, and the X-Man Rogue.<h2>Why did Hela turn evil?</h2>Hela was a wonderful wartime leader, or executioner as she called herself; proudly serving as Odin's general in conquest. However, when Odin transitioned into a peace-time King, Hela refused to oblige to this as her cruelty grew to become a threat to his new society.<h2>Why does Hela look like Loki?</h2>When Odin first found Loki, abandoned as a baby on Jotunheim, Loki changes from his Frost Giant blue to Asgardian pink. The theory is that baby Loki was able to see Odin's memories, including his imprisoned daughter Hela, and he manifested his appearance to look like her.<h2>Who kills Hela?</h2>Hela slew Thor, who was restored to life by the sacrifice of her servant, the Silent One. Hela was then slain by Odin to save Thor, but then returned to life by Odin after being convinced by Thor to restore the natural balance of life and death.<h2>Who has Loki slept with?</h2>Loki also reproduced with his mistress, Angrboda, a jötunn (possibly a troll) who gave birth to three children: Hel, who ruled the eponymous underworld called Hel, Jörmungandr, the sea serpent of Midgard and arch-nemesis of Thor, and Fenrir, the massive wolf fated to slay Odin during Ragnarök.<h2>Did Thor marry a giant?</h2>Thor is the son of Odin and Fjorgynn, or Jord, and is married to Sif. He is a big eater and enjoys the honey-based drink mead. As the champion of order in the world, he battles against giants and other monsters. It might be because of his power and strength that he appears in so many stories.<h2>Is Hela Frigga's daughter?</h2>The identity of Hela's mother wasn't revealed in the film, but as it turns out, she's actually Thor's half-sister, as she isn't the daughter of Frigga. As it has done with many other characters, the MCU changed many details from the comics, including Hela's family tree.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKGdnJZ6tbTOq6pmr5mbsg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
