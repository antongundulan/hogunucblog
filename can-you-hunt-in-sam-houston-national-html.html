data-sourcepos=11:1-11:77><span>Here's the nitty-gritty:</span><span> you gotta have a </span><strong>valid hunting license</strong><span> and an </span><strong>Annual Public Hunting Permit (APH)</strong><span>.</span><span> Think of it like your VIP pass to the hunting grounds.</span><span> Don't worry,</span><span> it's not like applying for grad school – the process is pretty straightforward.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:255><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><span> Check the Texas Parks and Wildlife website (</span><a class=traceable-link rel="noopener

data-sourcepos=20:1-20:100><strong>Feral Hogs:</strong><span> These bristly bandits are considered pests,</span><span> so go hog wild (see what we did there?</span><span>) – there's no closed season for these suckers.</span><span> Just remember,</span><span> they're mean,</span><span> magnificent,</span><span> and weigh a ton,</span><span> so respect their tusks!</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=21:1-22:0><strong>Turkey, Ducks, Doves, Rabbits, and Squirrels:</strong><span> These smaller game birds and mammals are all fair game,</span><span> depending on the season,</span><span>
