According to TMZ, the Roc-A-Fella co-founder filed documents in his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">custody case with his ex-wife</a>, Rachel Roy, who he shares a daughter with, claiming that he can’t afford the current amount.

He explained that it’s largely because he’s embarked on several business ventures over the past few years, though they haven’t necessarily panned out in the way that he’d hoped. At one point, he revealed his annual income in 2022 was just a little over $5,000. In fact, he said that he didn’t make any more than $5,140 that year. Dame Dash explained that he was hit by the pandemic and hardly recovered since then.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Read More:</strong></p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rachel-roy-responds>Rachel Roy Responds</h2></span><p>Rachel Roy and Damon Dash during GQ Magazine Celebrates BVLGARI's New Ergon Watch with "The Men Who Embody New York Spirit and Style" at Table 50 in New York City, New York, United States.

However, she isn’t necessarily buying his argument. In response to his court filing, Roy explained that he still has a stake in Roc-A-Fella Records, which should continue to provide him with a solid income. Meanwhile, she added that he has other businesses that he’s yet to disclose to the public. So far, a judge has yet to make a ruling on Dame’s request or Roy’s response. We’ll keep you posted on anymore updates.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Interestingly enough, the topic of his ownership in Roc-A-Fella surfaced just weeks before. During an interview with The GAUDS Show, Dash said that he’s taking back <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Roc-A-Fella</a>. “Roc-A-Fella never dies. It’s not dead; I just fuckin’ took a vacation. I’m the CEO of Roc-A-Fella Inc. and JAY-Z knows it, and so does Biggs. Not Roc-A-Fella LLC — we sold that; Roc-A-Fella Inc. — I’m still the CEO,” he said. His comments came a few years after his alleged attempt to sell his stake in Roc-A-Fella and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>’s Reasonable Doubt album as an NFT.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
