He is considered one of the best rappers of the 2010s and is well-deserving of that title. Joey has a music catalog to prove that he is one of the best and has cosigns from many different hip hop legends. He came up as a <a href=# rel>member of Pro Era</a> alongside <a href=# class=text-word rel>Capital STEEZ</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kirk Knight</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>CJ Fly</a>, Nyck Caution, and others. So far, Joey Badass has released only three studio albums, two mixtapes, and an EP. He has consistently put out great songs with a “quality over quantity” approach.&nbsp;</p><p>This list ranks Joey Badass’s studio albums and mixtapes from worst to best. This list excludes <a href=# class=text-word rel>Pro Era</a> albums, mixtapes, and the Beast Coast album. Because Joey is so consistent, placing albums at the bottom is challenging, which speaks to just how strong his catalog is. Look at the list below, which starts at No. 5 and works its way up to Joey Badass’s best album.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-2000-2022>5. 2000 (2022)</h2></span><p>Last year marked the tenth anniversary of Joey’s debut mixtape, 1999, a very impactful project now considered a classic. Following a five-year gap between albums, Joey Badass released his third studio album, 2000, commemorating a decade of success. It is a stellar project but does not quite match the quality of his other albums in terms of both songwriting and production. Though 2000 does not stack up to his better albums, it has many standout songs. What makes it a unique album is that it comes from the perspective of Joey as an OG in the game. He may have only been 27 when the album was released, but it shows just how long Joey and Pro Era have existed in the scene. Essential Tracks: “Make Me Feel,” “Brand New 911,” ”Zipcodes,” “Head High,” “Survivors Guilt”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-summer-knights-2013>4. Summer Knights (2013)</h2></span><p>Joey Badass’s second mixtape, 2013’s Summer Knights, is easily his most underrated project. While many view it as inferior to 1999, some of the best Joey Badass songs are on Summer Knights. “Hillary Swank” still remains one of Joey’s best songs. The mixtape doubles down on the throwback ‘90s sound he built his style around. It also included more original production, allowing Joey to find his voice.</p><p>He showcased new flows and cadences on the album that would become his signature. Summer Knights is also a significantly more personal project than 1999, following the death of Joey’s close friend and groupmate Capital STEEZ. Songs like “LongLiveSteelo” show a level of vulnerability that Joey had never tapped into previously. Summer Knights is a great mixtape, but its lengthy runtime and particular production choices place it at No. 4. Essential Tracks: “Hillary Swank,” “My Yout,” “Death of YOLO,” “95 Til Infinity,” “Unorthodox”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-1999-2012>3. 1999 (2012)</h2></span><p>When <a href=# class=text-word rel>Joey Bada$$</a> released his debut mixtape 1999, he was only 17 years old and was still a student at Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn. With this mixtape, Joey and his fellow Pro Era groupmates helped reintroduce the classic boom-bap sound of the 1990s to a new generation. He built his sound around the sounds of the throwback style of instrumentals he chose. Some of these beats were original, while others were just some of Joey’s favorites.</p><p>Because not every sound is original and Joey hadn’t found his style yet, 1999 ranks third on this list. Joey managed to sound unique over a preexisting style while clearly emulating his influences, making for a quality mixtape. 1999 is now an all-time classic release and fan favorite that still gets brought up in hip hop discussions today. Essential Tracks: “Waves,” “Survival Tactics,” “Killuminati,” “Hardknock,” “World Domination”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-all-amerikkkan-bada-2017>2. ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$ (2017)</h2></span><p>Joey Badass’s second studio album, 2017’s ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$, marked a significant change in sound and content for Joey. The production was more polished and musical, departing from the <a href=# rel>boom-bap-inspired sound</a> many still pigeonhole Joey into. The songs on the album included live instrumentation and featured Joey at his most politically charged. The album's central themes tackled Black oppression, both the past and present.</p><p>Even with the album’s serious messaging, Joey finds balance. There are politically-charged songs like “Babylon” and warm, celebratory tracks with catchy choruses like “Temptation.” Essential Tracks: “Temptation,” “Devastated,” “Rockabye Baby,” “Babylon,” “Legendary.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-b4-da-2015>1. B4.DA.$$ (2015)</h2></span><p>Joey Badass’s first two mixtapes were amazing on their own, but they showed signs of potential that had yet to be unlocked. The mixtapes slowly led up to his highly-anticipated debut album, 2015’s B4.DA.$$, which is easily his best work. The album is phenomenal from top to bottom, balancing different moods and styles while sticking to a cohesive sound. A lot of the best Joey Badass songs are on this album. From the explosive “No. 99” to the nostalgic “Curry Chicken,” Joey showcases his versatility while remaining true to his sound.</p><p>B4.DA.$$ is a culmination of all of the best qualities of Joey’s previous releases and is undoubtedly his best album. It is a classic hip hop album and ranks high in his catalog and among the best rap albums of the 2010s.&nbsp;Essential Tracks: “Save The Children,” “Paper Trail$,” “Big Dusty,” “Hazeus View,” “Christ Conscious.”</p><p>Overall, Joey Badass has made some quality albums throughout the years, each with amazing songs. He has no bad records but has evolved so much over the years that some albums are more refined. The ranking of Joey’s catalog comes down to whether one prefers a more raw or refined style of rapping and production. Joey Badass started rapping at 17, and now over a decade into his career, he is still only 28 years old and continues to put out great albums. Hopefully, he does not take too long to release more music.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoZ5hJVmoaidqWKvorDArKpmmZyXwq6%2FjKagsayRpbK0edGapaSdlA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
