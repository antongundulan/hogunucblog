In the documentary "Gordon Lightfoot: If You Could Read My Mind," he said: "I was at the height of my drinking and I [looked] terrible. It was time to pack it in." Lightfoot added, "I don't know how I made it through." But he did make it through&nbsp;and went on to what became a lifelong career.</p><p dir=ltr>Lightfoot was married three times, according to the <a href=#>National Post</a>, and he had six children, so he certainly had a full life that included family and performance. At 80, Lightfoot spoke with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> about touring even in old age. "I've always been out on the road. I did about 80 shows last year," he said. Fittingly, his tour was called "80 Years Strong," so he certainly knew how to make the most of his talent.</p><p dir=ltr>Lightfoot spoke to USA Today about touring as an 80-year-old, saying, "I notice I'm slowing down. But we've got lots of toe-tappers in our show, and I've got a really great orchestra and we love to play. Because we're good at it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnaIR0gY6tqZqfmZh6pbHArZ9mn5%2BnsbC6jKWgoKCkm7ywwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
