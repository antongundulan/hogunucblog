"I don’t know how to just be in the moment and not be focused on what I’m doing next," he confessed.</p><p id=eV34N-d_9r5 data-wc=43>Since largely stepping back from Hollywood in 2008, Frankie suggested that a significant portion of his income likely comes from residual checks from the sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, which earned him an Emmy Award and ran for seven seasons starting in 2000.</p><p id=eaN9USbU8Su data-wc=14>&nbsp;At the peak of the show's success, he was earning approximately $150,000 per episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb68d59bce93-67f18f52abce4d17fe1c1bed283c8084.jpg><p id=enmskmYmVTR data-wc=21>Frankie, once dubbed “Hollywood’s most bankable teen,” starred in successful films like Agent Cody Banks, Big Fat Liar, and Racing Stripes.&nbsp;</p><p id=evBnKgZZclb data-wc=18>His decision to step away from the limelight was rooted in mental health considerations and overcoming "impostor syndrome."&nbsp;</p><p id=e5fY_CzLzor data-wc=30>Speaking to news.com.au before his adventure in the South African jungle, he shared his sense of alienation within the Hollywood scene despite his accolades and appearances at major award ceremonies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe4fa9f52985-9885895a664c600377cd1c3d95e1a70a.jpg><p id=e8GmtxSIfqs data-wc=48>"I never felt like I fully fit in the Hollywood world," he expressed, highlighting his disconnection and dissatisfaction with life in LA. A spontaneous move to Arizona changed his perspective, where he found joy in simple pleasures like observing nature and grocery shopping—experiences that felt burdensome in LA.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1Oyx3S7QXF data-wc=66>“I hated LA, so I kind of stayed in my own little world, my own little bubble. And moving to Arizona, I did it on a whim, and I realised immediately that I started looking up. I started enjoying looking at trees and birds in the sky. Going to the grocery store was a fun thing. You don’t get that in LA. It’s a miserable experience.”</p><p id=ePlK9wvgu9J data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
