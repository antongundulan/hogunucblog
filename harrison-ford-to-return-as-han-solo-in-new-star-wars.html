It's some time in the future.</p><p>He continued, "Han, Princess Leia (with a presumably better hairstyle), and Luke Skywalker will be a lot older. Their children will be the new main characters."</p><p>Adding, "But suffice to say, the three main actors are definitely coming back."</p><p>Disney announced in October that it will revive the classic sci-fi franchise by releasing a new trilogy.</p><p><i>Star Wars: Episode VII</i>, directed by <strong>J.J.

"He's collecting the two franchises and holding them close to his vest. He's probably the most talented director of that ilk that we have, but he's gone too far this time."</p><p>Shatner added, "I think of him as a buddy of mine. I've taken him out for sushi.
