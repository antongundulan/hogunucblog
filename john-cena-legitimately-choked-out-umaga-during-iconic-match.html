When Cena started his career in WWE back in 2002, his character was viewed as a very uninspiring babyface with no personality."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was the face of the company and Cena worked very hard to maintain his top position as well. It seems Cena legitimately choked out Umaga during one of their iconic matches as well.</p><p>When Cena started his career in WWE back in 2002, his character was viewed as a very uninspiring babyface with no personality. It wasn’t until he introduced his Dr. Of Thuganomics gimmick that Cena became a star in the company.</p><p>Cena then became a big deal after winning the WWE Title in 2005. One of Cena’s most important feuds during the early years of him being at the top was against Umaga. The two had an incredible Last Man Standing match at the 2007 Royal Rumble.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monday Mailbag with Mike Chioda on AdFreeShows.com</a>, Mike Chioda recalled John Cena legitimately choking out Umaga during the 2007 Royal Rumble match.</p><p>“Umaga couldn’t answer anything. He was out like a light. That’s why I got so worried about Eckie [Umaga.] I was thinking, was he concussed? But no, the rope got him and choked him out, and he passed out. I didn’t even know Eckie was passed out. He was shoot passed out. He was totally out of it. He finally woke up. I was like, ‘Are you alright? That was nuts.’ It was the ring rope that choked him out. John was pulling too hard. He was tugging too hard. I felt bad because as a referee, you have to know what’s going on in there. I was like, ‘Eckie, I just thought you were selling so good.’ He said, ‘I was trying to tell you but I couldn’t get it out.’ He couldn’t talk but he was trying to tell me it was too tight, and I couldn’t even hear him.”</p><p>Cena even had <a href=#>heat on him for choking opponents with the STF</a>. We will have to wait and see when John Cena will return to the company as fans will always be glad to see the Leader of Cenation back in any capacity.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>h/t to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestlingNews.co</a>&nbsp;for the quotes</p><p>February 22, 2022 6:16 am</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ze49rZmtqX5%2B8qbqMnJynmV2hsqi106KkmqyVocZur8eoop6cXaTCtXnUppigmV2ZwrO1zaBkopufo7akecyaq5ygXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
