According to some interpretations, these companions are beautiful women who are created for the pleasure of men who die as martyrs in the cause of God. The number 72 is derived from a hadith (a report of the words or actions of Prophet Muhammad) that states that each martyr will have 72 wives in Paradise.</p><p>The film explores the role of brainwashing in the context of religious terrorism, particularly the titular promise of “72 virgins in heaven” for believers committing suicide attacks in the name of Jihad.&nbsp;It portrays how terror outfits convince innocent Muslim youth to attack non-Muslims by luring them with the assurance of Jannat (Paradise) and heavenly virgins (untouched women) in the afterlife.&nbsp;It also depicts the “consequences of violent extremism.”</p><p>The film has been praised by some critics and audiences for its bold and realistic depiction of a sensitive issue.&nbsp;It has also won several awards and accolades, including the ICFT-UNESCO Gandhi Medal Special Mention at the 2019 International Film Festival of India (IFFI) and the National Film Award for Best Direction for Chauhan in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Analysis</h2><p>The film has sparked a debate on the freedom of expression and artistic creativity versus the respect for religious sentiments and communal harmony. While some have defended the film as a creative work that exposes the dark side of terrorism and challenges the distorted interpretation of Islam, others have condemned it as a propaganda piece that insults Islam and maligns the image of Muslims.</p><p>The film also raises questions on the role and responsibility of filmmakers and censor boards in dealing with controversial topics that may offend or hurt certain sections of society. How far can filmmakers go in depicting their artistic vision without compromising on social responsibility? How much can censor boards intervene in regulating or modifying such content without violating artistic freedom? How can both parties balance artistic expression and social sensitivity?</p><p>These are some of the questions that need to be addressed in order to ensure that films like 72 Hoorain do not become sources of conflict or violence, but rather catalysts for dialogue and understanding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>72 Hoorain is a film that has generated a lot of controversy and criticism for its portrayal of religious terrorism and its alleged promise of 72 virgins in heaven. A Mumbai man has filed a police complaint against the makers of the film for insulting Islam and maligning the Muslim community. The film has also faced opposition from some Kashmir-based political parties and censor board issues.</p><p>However, the film has also received praise and recognition for its bold and realistic depiction of a sensitive issue and its challenge to the distorted interpretation of Islam. The film raises questions on the freedom of expression and artistic creativity versus the respect for religious sentiments and communal harmony, and the role and responsibility of filmmakers and censor boards in dealing with controversial topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6LCrq7AomSmmZ5is6q4xKxknKedpbmitc2tZJqfkZ67tMCMn6ClpV1sf260zqipmqGeYrOwvoyhrKusmaO0brnUrKOipV2osq%2FAyKacp6yjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
