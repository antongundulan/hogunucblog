</strong>2024-08-18</div><p><span>If by any chance you are a big basketball fan, it is impossible that you have not met the Ball family.&nbsp;This is the original family of Liangelo Ball.&nbsp;He is the basketball star who played for Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas and was embroiled in a shoplifting controversy in China, which required the intervention of President Donald Trump and caught the attention of many people.&nbsp;Here’s what you need to know about him.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of LiAngelo Ball</span></strong></h2><p><span>November 24, 1998 was the date LiAngelo was born in Anaheim, California.&nbsp;He was raised by his parents, Tina and LaVar Ball, alongside his younger brother LaMelo Ball and older brother Lonzo Ball.&nbsp;It is very interesting to note that while growing up, LiAngelo and his two brothers started playing basketball from childhood.&nbsp;It was because both of their parents were into the sport in different ways.</span></p><p><span>For his studies, LiAngelo Ball attended the Chino Hills High School and from here he went to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).&nbsp;Nonetheless, he was forced out of college following the incident that involved him in a shoplifting case in China, following which he was suspended.</span></p><p><span>The major controversy he got involved in was when he was arrested with his friends in Shanghai after they were allegedly caught wearing sunglasses.&nbsp;For the alleged crime, the three men could have spent between three and 10 years behind bars, but were released following what the Trump administration said was intervention by the President of the United States.</span></p><p><span>Although Trumped asked LiAngelo and his friends to thank him for his intervention, they realized their release was already in the works.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Basketball&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Statistics</span></strong></h2><p><span>So far, LiAngelo is yet to have any significant stats as he hasn’t played in many professional games or even in college since leaving as a freshman.&nbsp;Looking at his stats with Vytautas Prienu, he has played 15 games and started in 7 of the games.&nbsp;He recorded 193 points.</span></p><p><span>The young ball was hoping to make it to the NBA through the 2018 draft, but he was unable to make it at the combine draft in Chicago.&nbsp;Thus, the former Prienu Vytautas player now intends to go through the back door, as his father said.</span></p><p><span>What LaVar wants is for all of his boys to be signed by the Lakers and that is LiAngelo’s interest, but it remains to be seen if he can land a jersey.&nbsp;The chances of that happening are slim as sources have revealed the Lakers don’t even believe he’s good enough even for the G-League.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>LiAngelo has a girlfriend named IzzyMorris.&nbsp;The two have been dating for a while, but as he pointed out, he doesn’t like to talk about his relationship, even though the two are still seen together on their social media.</span></p><p><span>Also known as Isabella Morris, Instagram-turned-star Izzy was born on December 10, 1999, in Chino Hills, California.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>LiAngelo Ball, like his other brothers, is interested in basketball both in appearance and skill.&nbsp;That said, he is 2.0 m (6 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tattoos and Facts</span></strong></h2><ul><li><span>The young baller got a back tattoo.&nbsp;Why the question of his tattoo became interesting to many people is because his father always hated tattoos and only knew his son had one on himself when he went for treatment .&nbsp;Of course, like any man who hates inks, LaVar was shocked to see it, even when the tattoos said things like Live a long and healthy life as he told his brother and a large cross on his chest.</span></li><li><span>As stated, LiAngelo comes from a basketball family.&nbsp;While his father played sports in college and later he played football, his mother also played when she was a student.</span></li><li><span>His brother Lonzo plays in the NBA for the Los Angeles Lakers and LaMelo for the Los Angeles Ballers.</span></li><li><span>Due to the family’s passion for basketball, it was LaVar who started the Junior Basketball Association.</span></li><li><span>Her mother, Tina Ball suffered a stroke from which she is still recovering gradually with the help of the whole family.&nbsp;Before falling ill, Tina worked as an athletic director at Vernon Middle School in Montclair, California.</span></li><li><span>His family is very wealthy with a number of investments in men’s and women’s sportswear.&nbsp;The family owns the Big Baller brand.&nbsp;That said, his father, LaVar, has a net worth of $4 million, while his brother, Lonzo, has a net worth of $14 million.</span></li></ul><p class=postsid
