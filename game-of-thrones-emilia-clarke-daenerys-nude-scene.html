Daenerys Targaryen was on fire on last night's Game of Thrones—literally. The Mother of Dragons provided the episode's epic ending by burning the temple of the Dosh Khaleen and her khal antagonizers with it, then emerging from the flames unburnt and unclothed.
Actress Emilia Clarke revealed that she did actually strip down to play Daenerys in this scene. You might think that's kind of a no-brainer considering Khaleesi appeared naked in the shots, but Clarke's history of doing nude scenes on GoT has been murky."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She added, "If it's gratuitous for gratuitous sake, then I will discuss with a director on how to make it more subtle."&nbsp;The actress was also in the running for&nbsp;Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey, but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a10388/emilia-clarke-fifty-shades-role-turn-down/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="turned down the role" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">turned down the role</a> because of nudity.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So what changed her mind?&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'd like to remind people the last time I took my clothes off was season 3," Clarke told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/15/game-thrones-emilia-clarke-dany data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But she&nbsp;wasn't completely out in the open. Although the Dothraki scenes were filmed in a desert in Spain, her nude scene was filmed separately on a private set in Belfast.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Taking off my clothes is not the easiest thing, but with the magic of the effects, I don't have to do a Season 1 and go on a cliff and do it.&nbsp;I'm in control of it," she&nbsp;said. Clarke also noted that her male costar&nbsp;Michiel Huisman, who plays Daenery's lover Daario Naharis, doesn't get questioned about nudity as much as she does.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"How many times has&nbsp;Michiel Huisman been asked about the fact he's taken his clothes off a bunch? Is that even a discussion? No. So I'm doing it this year and people can talk about it and I'm ready to answer any questions about it, basically."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much like Daenerys, Emilia Clarke is in control now.&nbsp;Watch her talk more about last night's ending in the behind the scenes video below.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
