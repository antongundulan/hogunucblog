I’ll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken,” he wrote on IG. With her engagement presumably over, she and Tyga began spending more time together. A source close to the artists said that they were spending time with each other, though it was unclear what to make of their relationship. That is until <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Paris Fashion Week</a>. The couple shared a kiss in front of the cameras, leaving the Internet in disarray of the union between the “Rack City” rapper and “Complicated” songstress.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyga-avril-lavigne-make-it-ig-official>Tyga & Avril Lavigne Make It IG Official</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It’s quite clear that the relationship between Tyga and Avril has escalated quickly. While the couple’s appearance at Paris Fashion Week seemed to confirm their relationship, Tyga took it a step further and made their relationship known on the ‘Gram. The rapper shared a few looks from PFW with Avril Lavigne by his side while quoting <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>’s bars from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>’s “Superhero.” “Shout out to Dallas,” he wrote, allowing fans to finish the caption for him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At this point, Avril Lavigne hasn’t publicly confirmed her relationship with Tyga but we suspect that her recent break-up with Mod Sun played a role in that decision. Avril and Mod Sun confirmed they were together in September 2021. By March 2022, he popped the question, which she described as “the most perfect, romantic proposal I could ever ask for.” However, nearly a year later, the couple were on-and-off, and apparently, Tyga swooped in from there. We’ll keep you posted on anymore updates on the lovebirds.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
