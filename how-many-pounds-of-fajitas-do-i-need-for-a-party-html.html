In addition, I charge half a pound each person. I cook one pound of beans for every eight persons in my family. Beans are inexpensive, so you may always add an additional pound to be on the safe side.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>As a result, the issue is: how many pounds of fajita meat do I need for an 80-person gathering?</h3><p>2 pounds raw lean boneless beef for 5 people PLUS 2 pounds whole bone-in chicken for each 5-6 people OR 1 pound boneless skinless chicken for 4 people is the recommended amount. Bell peppers are equal in weight to the meat, while onions are about half the weight of the meat.</p><p></p><h3>What I’m trying to figure out is how many pounds of fajitas I’ll need for 30 guests.</h3><p>That equates to around 10-15 pounds of cooked beef for 30 persons. When it comes to flank steak and chicken breasts, you may expect roughly 30 percent cooking shrinkage, which means you’ll need 14-21 lbs of raw meat to begin with.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>I’m making fajitas and I’m wondering how much chicken I should use.</h3><p>The beef for fajitas is prepared as follows: To feed four people, you’ll need one boneless, skinless chicken breast, chicken cutlets, or skirt steak every quarter pound of chicken. For chicken breasts, pound them until they’re approximately 1/2 inch thick; for skirt steak, cut each steak in half so that it fits easily into the pan. Preheat your skillet to medium heat.</p><p></p><h3>There were 14 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>How many pounds of fajitas are required to serve a group of fifty people?</h3><p>Amounts per individual and for a group of 100 persons If you’re serving two fajitas per person and serving them with the customary sides of rice, beans, and salad, that’s a good estimate.
