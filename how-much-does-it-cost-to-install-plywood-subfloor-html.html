Cost to Replace, Repair or Install Subfloor
 The average cost to replace or repair a plywood subfloor in a 306-square-foot room costs $555, or between $490 and $600. The average cost to install a new plywood subfloor is $620, or between $572 and $720.
Correspondingly, how much does it cost to install plywood underlayment? The cost of your underlayment depends on what you use for materials; for example, if you are installing a hardwood floor, you may use inexpensive plywood for your underlayment at $1."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In order to replace the subfloor, the finished floor needs to be removed first. If there is an underlayment that will also be removed.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>36 Related Question Answers Found</h3><h3><b>Can I put new subfloor over old subfloor?</b></h3><p>One of the benefits of removing the old flooring is it allows you the chance to fix any loose subflooring or squeaks by re-securing the main subfloor to the floor joists prior to installing the new flooring. With all that being said though the answer is YES you can install New Wood Flooring over the old.</p><p></p><h3><b>What kind of plywood do you use for subfloor?</b></h3><p>While OSB is the most popular structural panel, CDX plywood is the most popular type of traditional or “veneer” plywood. CDX plywood is like other laminate plywoods, but the outer layers of laminate are grades “C” and “D,” which means they are cosmetically rough and contain many imperfections, thus lowering their cost.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>What size plywood is used for flooring?</b></h3><p>The thickness of your plywood subfloor depends on the joist spans. The National Wood Flooring Association recommends a minimum plywood panel thickness of 7/8-inch for joist spans of 19.2 to 24 inches, and a minimum plywood panel thickness of 5/8-inch for joist spans of 16 inches or less.</p><p></p><h3><b>Does the wet subfloor need to be replaced?</b></h3><p>Does a wet subfloor need to be replaced? In cases of extensive water damage, drying the subfloor after a flood can be very difficult, and that complicates repairs. Soaked wood quickly develops mould and rot that impacts adjacent framing and drywall. In this kind of situation, it’s best to replace the entire expanse.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>How much is a sheet of plywood?</b></h3><p>Cabinet Grade Plywood Thickness Type Price 1/4″ Oak Plywood $25.97 1/2″ Oak Plywood $42.97 1/2″ Birch (3 ply) $41.97 3/4″ Birch (5 ply) $44.97</p><p></p><h3><b>How much does plywood flooring cost?</b></h3><p>Costs Average costs of graded plywood flooring and installation charges Grade Purchase Cost Installation cost Low $3 to $5 per sq.ft. $3 to $10 per sq.ft. Medium $5 to $10 per sq.ft. $3 to $10 per sq ft. High $8 to $13 per sq.ft. $3 to $10 per sq ft.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>How many layers of plywood do you need for a subfloor?</b></h3><p>Floating subfloor: There are two common methods for this. The first is to lay two layers of 3/8-inch plywood over the slab without fastening or glueing them to the slab. One layer is laid, and the second layer is stapled or glued perpendicularly or diagonally over the top.</p><h3><b>Do you nail or screw subfloor?</b></h3><p>When you use a nail gun to attach subfloor sheathing to the floor joists, the nail sometimes misses the joist. Remember, nails can pull up; screws don’t. This gives us stronger floors that will not move or squeak.</p><p></p><h3><b>How thick should a subfloor be?</b></h3><p>Typically made of plywood or OSB and ranging in thickness from 19/32″ to 1 1/8″ thick, the subfloor is truly structural, second only to joists in this respect. Subfloor holds up all of the above layers of flooring, as well as everything in your house—people, dogs, cats, pianos, furniture. All houses have subfloors.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>What screws should I use for subfloor?</b></h3><p>Steel Screws The proper steel screw sizes for securing 3/4-inch plywood to the floor joists are #8, #10 and #12 screws. The number refers to the thickness of the screw. Each is available in lengths from 1 1/4 to 3 inches. Typically, the 3-inch variety is used to secure plywood subfloors.</p><h3><b>&nbsp;</b></h3><h3><b>What is better for subfloor OSB or plywood?</b></h3><p>The National Tile Contractors Association and the Resilient Floor Covering Institute both recommend plywood for subflooring and underlayment, because it doesn’t have the risk of swollen edges that OSB does. Plywood also has a slight advantage in stiffness, which means that subflooring panels need not be quite as thick.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBlnaqwqXnDqJysZZmpeqS70q1kraddnru0wMClo2aonK7EsLvDZqqumpahvLC%2BjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
