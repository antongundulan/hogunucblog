All of those were nothing on her latest look, however …</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yep, we can officially announce that Kidman has just made her naked dressing debut, and true to form, it was both sexy and so chic.</p><img alt="sydney, australia december 20 nicole kidman attends a special screening of expats at palace verona on december 20, 2023 in sydney, new south wales photo by don arnoldwireimage" title="&amp;amp;quot;Expats&amp;amp;quot; Special Screening - Arrivals" width=3076 height=4614 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1869327437-65835b3a68ef5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Don Arnold</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Attending a screening of her upcoming Prime Video drama series <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/beauty-hair/celebrity-hair-makeup/a45031989/nicole-kidman-short-hair/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Expats class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Expats</a> alongside husband Keith Urban in Sydney, Australia, Kidman looked absolutely incredible in a nude-colored gown complete with a thigh-high slit and plunging neckline. With her hair piled up in curls on top of her head and nothing but a chunky gold midi-arm bangle as an accessory, this is exactly how we imagine a Greek goddess would look while repping the naked dressing trend, tbh. Niche, we know—but you get the gist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kidman’s dress is a design from Fendi’s Autumn/Winter ’23 couture show, in the perfect shade of nude, only minimally different from the color of her skin, creating a sexy trompe l’oeil effect. Even better, the intricate drapery of the gown is reminiscent of the super-thin sheath robes depicted on ancient Greek statues–so we weren’t totally off with the goddess reference, after all. Either way, it’s one of the most beautiful examples we’ve ever seen of a naked dress that’s not actually naked in the slightest. Kidman always has been one to keep things classy.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/13bdcdbd-2cea-40d8-8119-12596f408ebe_1642775203.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Clementina Jackson" title="Headshot of Clementina Jackson" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>&nbsp;Clementina Jackson is the Fashion Editor at Cosmopolitan and Women’s Health UK, covering everything from <a href=#></a> and catwalk trends to buzzy brands and the cult products you need to know about (and shop before they sell out).
