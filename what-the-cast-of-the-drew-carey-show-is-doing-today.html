Since and before then, Stiles has led a successful career as a comedian, participating on different shows such as "Who's The Boss?" "Mad About You," and "Two and a Half Men." In the latter, he portrayed the recurring role of Dr. Herb Melnick, Judith's second husband.</p><p dir=ltr>However, most people will know or remember Stiles from "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" During the first version of the show, Stiles joined co-star Drew Carey, Colin Mochrie, Laura Hall, and Wayne Brandy. After nearly a decade, the show ended in 2007. It was Mochrie who announced via <a href=#>Twitter</a>, "Oh, by the way, 'Whose Line' is coming back. More details later," in 2013. This time around, Aisha Tyler was the host as Stiles, Hall, and Brandy returned to the show. Stiles attracted the audience with his incredible comedic talent, but he was also an executive producer.</p><p>In the same manner he had announced the happy news, Mochrie announced the sad news in a <a href=#>tweet</a>&nbsp;in November 2022: "Hey everyone. Hope you are enjoying the current season of 'Whose Line.' In January, we shoot our final season. Thank you all for the support over the years."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpboZ3gY6wn5qsXam1pnnCmqqtZZ%2BberW0xGabq52nYrCivsSyZKygn6x6qr%2BMnaaippdiwbCwwLJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
