It wasn't subtle: Hung from the roof of Studio 54, dangling over the dance floor, was a giant crescent moon with a face, a cocaine spoon moving to and from its nose.</p><p>MSN called the drug-taking "endemic." It was just as much a part of the Studio 54 experience as the dancing. People openly took poppers on the dance floor, and less openly shot up heroin in dark corners. Not only was this accepted, but one of the biggest suppliers was the co-owner Steve Rubell. He infamously walked around wearing a padded coat that hid his stash of cocaine, Quaaludes, and poppers. If he liked you enough, he'd give you a little something. The owners knew they needed celebrities to keep coming, and they knew celebrities liked free drugs. So they would send limos to pick them up, making sure there was plenty of cocaine in them first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2twanBforK0v8SdZK6oXam1qrrGrGStoJGpeqmtz6mcp52UYq61edKtrJ2hn2KCdXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
