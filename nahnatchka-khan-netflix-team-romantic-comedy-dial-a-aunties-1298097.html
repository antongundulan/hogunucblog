Sutanto then took time making her decision before settling on Khan.</p><p>A search for writers will soon get underway.</p><p>“Dial A for Aunties is a brilliant and fun page-turning ride full of unbelievable plot twists; a date gone tragically wrong, well-intended but meddling aunties, an entirely fresh type of a heroine and a big romance,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vp original documentary and independent features, in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “With the singular talent of Nahnatchka Khan at the helm, we found the perfect pairing for this incredible and vibrant story.”</p><p>Davis Entertainment and Netflix recently teamed on Dolemite Is My Name, the Eddie Murphy-starring picture that earned a Golden Globe nomination for best comedy, won a Critics’ Choice Award for best comedy and received five NAACP Image Award nominations</p><p>Khan’s Fresh Off the Boat chronicled the life of a Taiwanese-American family. The ABC comedy ran for six seasons, wrapping up in January 2020, and was praised for bringing Asian American experiences to mainstream audiences. WME-repped Khan made her feature directorial debut with Netflix’s <a href=#>Always Be My Maybe</a>, the romantic-comedy told via the prism of Asian American culture that starred Ali Wong and Randall Park.</p><p>Sutanto, who has a Masters in creative writing from the University of Oxford, will also have another book debuting in 2021, a YA novel titled The Obsession from Sourcebooks. She is repped by UTA and Katelyn Detweiler of Jill Grinberg Literary Management.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK%2Btx6eYrZuYoK5ut8eapWamlamzrbXXZquemZ1iv7C5wKeroptdmLyuscOyZJ2hkaF6onnArqWtoZWoenJ%2BmHFncm9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
