"So what? <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I have great respect for Sen. Harris</a>. I have to wonder if the same stories about her dating history would have been written if she were a male candidate?" After their past circulated this week, Williams reposted his message with an additional thought.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It’s not new and it’s not news.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I’m focused on something</a> that actually matters - bringing a 29 year old Marine, @freetrevorreed home. If you want to help, follow @freetrevorreed," Williams shared. For those unfamiliar with the Trevor Reed initiative, Reed is a serviceman who was arrested while visiting his girlfriend in Russia. He has been held in jail there since August 2019.
