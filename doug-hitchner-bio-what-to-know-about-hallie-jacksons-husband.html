A year later, they got married in Perkasie, Pennsylvania in Bucks County.&nbsp;As you’d expect from a notoriously private couple, they had a very private wedding ceremony that few people knew about.&nbsp;In fact, only close friends and family members of the duo honored the union.&nbsp;Moreover, it was so exclusive that only a few photos from the wedding can be found on the Internet.</span></p><p><span>The couple are now proud parents of two daughters.&nbsp;Being private persons, the names of the two girls are unknown, as is their date of birth.&nbsp;We know, however, that the family lives together in New York.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Like most other things about Doug Hitchner, his exact net worth is not known.&nbsp;His wife, on the other hand, is said to be worth around $1 million as she earns over $210,000 a year in salary.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other interesting facts about Doug Hitchner</span></strong></h2><ul><li><span>Doug is a very private person and is apparently good at it.&nbsp;He was able to stay away from media life despite his marriage to a popular television journalist.</span></li><li><span>His wife, Hallie Marie Jackson has been a journalist since 2006 when she joined WBOC-TV.&nbsp;Born in 1984 and raised in Yardley, Pennsylvania, she attended Pennsbury High School before heading to Johns Hopkins University where she met her future husband, Hitchner.</span></li><li><span>Doug Hitchner was a very good baseball player and this earned him a job on the college coaching staff after graduation.&nbsp;He was a good player at Johns Hopkins University as he was considered an outstanding blocker and receiver during his time with the varsity team.</span></li><li><span>He only appears occasionally on Hallie’s social media pages, but neither of their daughters have appeared on Hallie’s social media pages.</span></li><li><span>Hitcher is a part-time hunter, and he’s good at it, too.&nbsp;His Instagram account shows that he hunts various animals ranging from ducks to deer.</span></li><li><span>He enjoys participating in various fishing events and has won several awards there.</span></li><li><span>Doug’s wife has been a senior White House correspondent for the network since early 2017. However, she also anchors for MSNBC.</span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGicn6q0brTIrZqhppWneqO1zmauoZmkYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMoZilpJmaequtwqSqqKajYrW2v8GapZ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
