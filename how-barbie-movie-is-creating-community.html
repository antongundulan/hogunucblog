For many, Barbie has evolved into more than a movie. It’s a movement, and an excuse to go out with friends and dress the way our younger selves dreamed we would as adults.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“So many people thought I would grow out of my love for pink and Barbie as I got older,” says Taylor Brione Ballard, an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/bytaylorbrione/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="event planner" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>event planner</u></a> and Barbie collector in Houston who rented out a theater for a private screening complete with raffle prizes, photo ops, and a pink carpet. “I started sharing an event invite in May. I was telling my mom, ‘I already paid this money, so I hope people are going to come.’ I ended up having 118 people.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My foremost memories of Barbie involve using her as a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a44591045/barbie-power-of-play/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vessel for storytelling" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>vessel for storytelling</u></a>. Beneath the surface, she conditioned me to view physical beauty, whiteness, and male validation as measures of success comparable to a college degree. Still, I spent weeks preparing to celebrate her this summer, much like Baldini. She says that initially, her decision to host a Barbie event was more influenced by timing than the movie itself. But as she embarked on the planning process, she became aware of how the doll had shaped her core beliefs, especially as an Afro-Latina woman raised in Italy.</p><img alt="barbie celebrations barbie parties" title="barbie celebrations barbie parties" width=3676 height=2451 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc5132-64c0133d93a7a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Lavonta Nixon</span><p>Taylor Brione Ballard (center) and friends for her premiere party</p><img alt="barbie celebrations" title="barbie celebrations" width=3936 height=2624 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc5284-64c01353eb27b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Lavonta Nixon</span><p>The turnout for Ballard’s Barbie party</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Barbie signifies the impressions I always had of America,” Baldini says. “She played a role in the way I could see myself achieving things [in the U.S.] that I never thought I’d be able to back home. Seeing Barbie, Ken, and maybe one Black doll in a castoff role, always a secondary character—for me, that was already, Wow, that’s amazing. When I was little, my dream, whenever I would think about the United States, was, okay, I’m going to be like Barbie. Barbie’s world is America.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ballard, who grew up with five Barbie-loving younger sisters, recalls her mom visiting multiple stores to find Black dolls for each of them. “My parents tried to get a different doll for everybody,” she says. “My mom went all over town just to leave one store with one doll for one girl. That’s really why I collect: I love having all of my Black dolls in one place.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The night of her event, Baldini met 15 Barbies and one Ken outside her local theater. The group gathered 90 minutes before the showing to bop between restaurants, discuss their predictions about the film, and take photos and videos in their Barbie best. Some people came just for the pre-movie hangout.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In the movie, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a44601504/america-ferrera-barbie-cover-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="America Ferrera" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>America Ferrera</u></a>’s daughter says Barbie can’t give up even if the world is messed up,” she says. “This event was confirmation for me, as the founder of this space, that I’m on the right path.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead of her screening, Ballard’s RSVP list grew so long, she enlisted her sisters to help with day-of logistics. One flew in from Oklahoma just for the event. “I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them,” she says. The final product was an hours-long blowout that welcomed everyone from elderly women to girls as young as four.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was almost like playing Barbies in real life,” Ballard reflects. “Everyone was so nice to everyone. Strangers helped strangers take pictures, we had food and signature drinks, strawberry milkshakes for the kids. It felt like that’s what we would be doing with our dolls.”</p><img alt="barbie parties celebrations" title="barbie parties celebrations" width=6000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc06500-64c01408d63cb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Liana E.</span><p>Giulia Baldini greeting guests before her screening event</p><img alt="barbie parties celebrations" title="barbie parties celebrations" width=6000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc06384-64c0141c72b2c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Liana E.</span><p>Baldini and guests ahead of the premiere</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baldini recorded videos of her guests before and after seeing Barbie. The first round focused on people’s hopes for the movie, while in the second, the group gave unfiltered impressions straight out of the theater. “In the ‘before’ [videos], I heard both opinions: that it’s exploitative for all this money to go to Barbie, and the other reaction, people who wanted to party but weren’t sure about the plot,” she says. “Afterward, there was still excitement, but people were pondering their emotions, especially the women—and especially the Black women. Because of this event, I was able to introduce many people for the first time, but also strike a nerve in the communities each of us represents.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It seems like every morning, women wake up to news that could destroy our futures. That’s especially true for women from marginalized communities, all of whom are disproportionately impacted by landmark decisions like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40208184/roe-v-wade-has-been-overturned-abortion/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the overturn of Roe v. Wade" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">the overturn of Roe v. Wade</a>. We’re experts at making the most of what we have, and in such a fraught political landscape, it’s crucial that we go all out in the name of joy. Celebrating Barbie is not a blind submission to capitalism; it’s a survival mechanism.</p><img alt="barbie parties" title="barbie parties" width=3835 height=5752 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc5104-64c0137105f3c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Lavonta Nixon</span><p>A guest attending the Barbie premiere</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In the movie, everybody’s Barbie,” Ballard says. “Although Margot Robbie is what society considers Barbie, she’s not the only Barbie. We’re all Barbie. Your Barbie is not my Barbie, and that’s the beauty of it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the hangout portion of her event, Baldini noticed women from outside of the group joining in on the fun. “It was so genuine to see people greeting each other, saying, ‘Hi, Barbie,’” she says. “It’s like saying, ‘I see you and we deserve this. We deserve to have fun.’”</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhtbGZpfXl%2BkWifqK9dl66zrsieZKanpp6ybrXSZpqrnZGptq%2BzjJympqWlo7a1xY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
