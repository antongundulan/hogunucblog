Fortunately, if Fable 4's latest trailer is anything to go by, it looks as though we can expect the latter in spades. While we've not seen any reveals as to the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/upcoming-games>upcoming game</a>'s mechanics, the reveal trailer did show off some stellar writing, as well as a hilarious performance from British comedian Richard Ayoade.</p><p>That said, we do know that Fable 4 will be an RPG. It also seems likely that it will follow the mold of its predecessors, offering real-time action with plenty of quests to complete and places to explore. Whether we'll see the return of Fable's iconic morality system remains to be seen, but I can't be alone in wanting to play a fantasy protagonist with a stonking pair of devil horns like you could in the original trilogy, right? Read on to find out everything we know about Fable 4 including analysis and predictions from the folks here at TechRadar Gaming.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=fable-4-cut-to-the-chase-3>Fable 4: cut to the chase</h2><ul><li><strong>What is it? </strong>The fourth installment in the mainline Fable franchise</li><li><strong>When is it coming out?</strong> There's no release date yet but don't expect it soon</li><li><strong>What can I play it on?</strong> TBC, but<strong> </strong>it's an Xbox exclusive</li><li><strong>Who is making it? </strong>Playground Games</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-fable-4-platforms><span>Fable 4 platforms</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg><p>As an Xbox exclusive, Fable 4 will be released for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x>Xbox Series X</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-s>Xbox Series S</a>, and PC, where it could be available on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-games-pass>Xbox Game Pass</a> from day one.

It was another cinematic trailer, showing Richard Ayoade playing a humble purveyor of fruit and vegetables as he bemoaned the antics of local fantasy heroes. It was a fun trailer but offered a distinct lack of concrete information about the wider plot or game mechanics. You can check it out below:</p><p>Right now, only two Fable trailers have been released: the world premiere announcement trailer, and the one shown off at Xbox Games Showcase 2023.

Sword combat was shown, with a warrior depicted in battle with a bandit before performing a sort of finishing move, throwing them to the ground.</p><p>Another shot of gameplay showed the main character throwing a fire bomb at a group of enemies, suggesting that these sorts of items might also be making a return. Unfortunately, this is all we've seen so far, alongside some in-engine cinematics.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox Games Marketing at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft>Microsoft</a>, did make it clear after the reveal that "it's obviously going to be a role-playing game" (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.gamesradar.com/fable-4-release-date-news-rumours/>via GamesRadar</a>). Though this gives us little to go on in terms of specifics, it confirms that Fable 4 will likely place an emphasis on storytelling, character customization, and player agency, much like its predecessors.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-fable-4-main-character><span>Fable 4 main character</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We don't yet know much about the Fable 4 main character, but there are a few details we can glean from the teasers we've seen so far. First, it seems likely that the main character will be a 'hero' of some kind. This could potentially spell a connection to The Guild of Heroes - a powerful organization of do-gooders who feature in the original Fable (2004).&nbsp;</p><p>It also seems likely that our hero will have to do battle with Richard Ayoade's giant at some point. The Fable franchise is no stranger to including celebrated actors and comedians. Fable 3 famously included Monty Python veteran John Cleese, comedian Stephen Fry, and actor Simon Pegg. The inclusion of Ayoade in Fable 4 beyond just a cameo in the trailer seems likely, given this tradition.&nbsp;</p><p>While it hasn't been confirmed, it also seems probable that our main character will also be highly customizable. The Fable games have always been big on letting you tweak your character physically and cosmetically and it would be odd for Fable 4 to not continue the trend. We might also see the return of appearance changes based on character morality, too. In the original trilogy, evil choices would net you devil horns and sinister-looking eyes while good choices would get you a halo and angel wings. We imagine Fable 4 will iterate on these systems in some way, though we're not sure quite what's in store at this stage.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-fable-4-news><span>Fable 4 news</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Xbox re-reveals Fable<br></strong>Fable was <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/fable-reboot-gets-comedic-trailer-involving-heroes-and-giants>finally re-revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase 2023 event</a>. Not much was shown, but it's clear that the game now has a strong tonal direction and comedic vibe to it. Hopefully, the next time we see the game, we'll get a look at the game mechanics as well as what to expect from the story.</p><p><strong>While you're waiting for Fable 4, why not check out our lists of the </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/best/best-xbox-series-x-games-the-xbox-series-xs-games-you-need-to-play><strong>best Xbox Series X games</strong></a><strong> and the </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/best-pc-games><strong>best PC games</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHCoamanJGne6S7zGilnq%2BjZLOirsueZG1ln6N6ua7OsWSsnaKesrR512arq5mZobKzedGeo56Zo5p6pa3TnmSgmZ2aerGt0qxkmqaUYsSprdNmrp5lm6O8uA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
