In 2017&nbsp;at the age of 29, the rising star was <strong>killed in a car accident before his audition for the show even aired</strong>. With his family's consent, his audition was shown - and it was an emotional watch&nbsp;to say the least.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/375eb82cd985-brand-rodgers-z.jpg><p id=e-2I4u8IBAd7 data-wc=8><strong>Brandon Rodgers tragically died before his auditon aired</strong></p><p id=eowqUwSm8hyC data-wc=61>After receiving a standing ovation from the crowd, the show's judges were full of praise for the talented doctor - including notoriously harsh judge&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, who told him: "Your vocals&nbsp;are stunning. Stunning. I have never said this before to a doctor – but you're sick. You are one of the best singers we have had in the completion so far."</p><h2>Tim Fort&nbsp;</h2><p id=e5N4MsLIbXyZ data-wc=34>Tim Fort, AKA The Kinetic King, appeared in season six of the show back in 2011. <strong>Sadly, Tim died five years later in 2016 after suffering a series of strokes when he was 51</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8f924cf9b77-tim-fortz-z.jpg><p id=eEoLCbfUzX-q data-wc=11><strong>Tim sadly died five years after his appearance on the show</strong></p><p id=eC_yaKmXapGx data-wc=44>Tim, who was already an internet sensation at the time of his audition, blew away the judges with his ingenious chain reaction gadgets.

His audition tape - that got him two yeses and one no from the judges - consisted of him stripping to Ricky Martin's She Bangs. Sadly, just one year later, in 2007, he died following a brief battle with prostate cancer.&nbsp;</p><h2>Francis Lee Strong</h2><p id=eT4mDmSXH2fN data-wc=53>At the age of 75, comedienne Francis Lee Strong decided to try her chances on the show and auditioned under the name of Grandma Lee.
