"And he's having people talk to him all the time about how they've opened up to family members for the first time and just think that's just incredible. If people are out there feeling lonely and it's never only ever happened to them, and then they see someone else who's gone through something similar, I think that's really special.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/60c906c603d6-richard-gadd-donny-dunn-baby-reindeer.jpg><h3>Baby Reindeer lawsuit worries</h3><p id=eJG9Rui5p3Gf data-wc=51>Jessica’s new interview comes following the controversy surrounding the hugely popular show, after the real-life counterpart of Jessica’s character Martha, Fiona Harvey, confirmed to Piers Morgan that she planned to sue Netflix for her portrayal in the show. She claimed that she was never convicted of stalking, which the show depicts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ccb11c4a262-screenshot-2024-04-11-at-162551.png><p id=eQ6kRcqjslRB data-wc=55>She said: “We’ve had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I’ve had no apology. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and… That’s not true.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd told production company ‘truth’ about stalker ‘Martha’" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/75e9bae0d6a7-donny-baby-reindeer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd told production company ‘truth’ about stalker ‘Martha’" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd told production company ‘truth’ about stalker ‘Martha’</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning talks return to hit show in a very different role" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1d4795942835-the-outlaws-s3-diane.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning talks return to hit show in a very different role" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning talks return to hit show in a very different role</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ewxnHPPDB-qo data-wc=24>She added: “I think he’s done bloody well out of defaming me… He’s making money out of untrue facts.

Speaking to The Independent about the situation, he said: “When we think of stalkers, we always think of films like Misery and Fatal Attraction, where the stalker is a monstrous figure in the night down an alleyway. But usually, it’s a prior relationship or someone you know or a work colleague.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dda5ca7845b0-baby-reindeer-martha.jpg><p id=eQNf8z_67ZdH data-wc=28>“Stalking and harassment is a form of mental illness.
