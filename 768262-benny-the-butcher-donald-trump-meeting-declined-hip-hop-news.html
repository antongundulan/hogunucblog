He made some unprompted pro Donald Trump comments online that didn't sit well with his fanbase. Rather than trying to make his case Benny seemed content to ignore the situation and try to move on from it as quickly as possible. In an interview that came a few weeks later he refused to open up on the motivation for his comments or if he's changed his mind. Instead, he merely said that he learned there are certain political beliefs that aren't for sharing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But now we may be getting an update on Benny's feelings. For the first time<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> since an interview last month</a> he appears to be making a comment about the former president. "Turned down a meeting with 45 last week" a tweet he made recently reads. While he doesn't mention Trump by name many are confident that's exactly who he's talking about. The former president is currently leading the race to once again become the republican nominee for this year's presidential election. He's simultaneously facing numerous legal proceedings both civil and criminal in multiple states, adding complications to the campaign. Check out Benny's tweet and the reactions to it below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-benny-the-butcher-declined-meeting-with-trump>Benny The Butcher Declined Meeting With Trump</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this month, Benny announced he was taking the album on tour. He and Boldy James will be hitting the road for a series of shows later this year on the "Everybody Can't Go Tour." The 18-date tour kicks off in mid-April and runs until May.
