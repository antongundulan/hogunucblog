Overall, No Jumper is a massive brand that originally started as a deep dive into the L.A. BMX scene. However, it eventually transitioned into underground hip-hop. Adam was one of the first to interview XXXTentacion, and even now, that interview is still watched by many.

This would make people think he is gay. Then, on April Fools Day, he revealed that he would be starring in his first gay porn scene. "I’m proud to announce my first ever gay scene!" Adam22 wrote. "For many years I have dreamed of what it would be like to shoot with one of the bros and I decided to stop holding back and live my truth! I know some of you won’t like this decision but I hope you will choose to respect my choice. Big thanks to my scene partner <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">@michaeldohertyx</a> for letting me tear that ass up! Can’t wait for yall to see this content!!!"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-adam22-goes-for-a-joke>Adam22 Goes For A Joke</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following the prank, fans were not amused on social media. Many said it was all in poor taste. However, a significant chunk of people just brushed it off, saying they thought Adam was gay anyways, and that a prank was unnecessary. It was a great example of a joke backfiring. Regardless, the whole think went viral, which was probably Adam's intention in the first place. One has to wonder what Lena The Plug thinks about all of this.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this stunt from Adam22, in the comments section below.
