His last televised appearance was during the Battle Royal at SummerSlam and since then, Omos has largely been competing at live events. After 55 days, Omos finally competed in a match against Akira Tozawa at the WWE SuperShow live event in Rochester, New York, where he would demolish Tozawa.</p><p>We will have to wait and see when Omos will make his return to WWE television, as the company does not seem to have any major plans for The Nigerian Nightmare at the moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of Omos finally competing in a match after almost two months?
