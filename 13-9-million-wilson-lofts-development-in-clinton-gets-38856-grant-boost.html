The overall development effort consists of creation of 33 residential apartments and the construction of the Makers on 5th and Clinton Culinary business incubators.</p><p>Entrepreneurs can open within the Makers on 5th or Clinton Culinary while having the option to live all within the Wilson Lofts through its comprehensive, mixed-use redevelopment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2021/12/Wilson2.png><p>An entirely new tax base is being created, and additional sales tax will be generated through the incubator spaces once GROWTH starts entering into leases, the release said. The incubators will be leased to entrepreneurs at significantly below-market rates that provides them an opportunity to build a foundation for success. The goals of both incubators are that the entrepreneurs expand into larger locations throughout Clinton and Clinton County.</p><ul><li>Clinton Culinary provides 5 incubator spaces targets culinary start-ups wishing to open within a storefront space with access directly from 5th Avenue South.</li><li>Makers on 5th provides 6 incubator spaces targeting start-up retailers and small businesses seeking to share space and resources to establish and grow eventually into a larger storefront</li></ul><p>Out of the $13.88 million in total project costs, $500,000 has been raised by GROWTH to build out the two incubator spaces. With rising construction costs, the CCDA grant will help toward completion of the buildout for incubators with additional sponsorships being sought.</p><p>Built in 1914 as Clinton’s largest and most modern office building, the Wilson Building stands six stories high, making it the tallest building in Clinton’s downtown business district.</p><p>“With more than 40 on the wait list for the apartments, and two businesses already interested in the incubators, we are confident that the Wilson Lofts will make a catalytic impact all while advancing multiple community plans addressing all components by celebrating history, housing, recreation, and a sense of place through the business incubators,” said Jon Davidshofer, GROWTH vice president and project lead for the Wilson Lofts. “The CCDA grant only adds to our excitement for this project.”</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=#>wilson-lofts.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaGhsZWliuqq4y6Kmp2Wnnrm0u81mo6iepKh6pbHVnqOoqJ2au7V5yKdknKSZo8GwuoygnK2rXWiFeYGVZp6rmZ6peqO7zqyraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
