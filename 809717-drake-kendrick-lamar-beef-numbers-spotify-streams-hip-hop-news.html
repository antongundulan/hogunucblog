For example, a lot of folks are curious as to how the "numbers" battle ended up between both mainstream juggernauts, and while "Not Like Us" has gotten a lot of the love in this regard, both artists certainly impressed. Moreover, a new graphic surfaced showing how The Boy and K.Dot's monthly listeners on Spotify changed throughout this battle. As of May 27, 2024, Kendrick's Spotify listeners rose from about 50 million to 77.11 million, whereas Drizzy's been comfortably at around 83 million all year.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition, this information from HipHopNMore's Navjosh via Chartmetric also includes breakdowns of each streamable diss track in the Kendrick Lamar and Drake battle, not including IG-only or deleted releases like "Taylor Made Freestyle," the "Buried Alive" reimagining, "6:16 In LA," or <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>'s "7 Minute Drill." The graphic compares the YouTube and Spotify streams for each song as of May 28, and if you want to count "First Person Shooter," that still remains the most overall streamed song here. However, "Like That" is a few million behind, and "Not Like Us" already reached <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">two-thirds of the For All The Dogs cut's streams on Spotify</a> and surpassed them on YouTube, so we'll see how this all evolves.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kendrick-lamar-amp-drake-s-diss-streams-compared>Kendrick Lamar & Drake's Diss Streams Compared</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Perhaps the most interesting part about these numbers is that Drake and Kendrick Lamar were much closer in the song-for-song competition than fans on either side probably give their opponent credit for. For example, the double-drop of "Family Matters" and "Meet The Grahams" sees each song with pretty much the same number of streams, with Aubrey Graham slightly ahead. While he may have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more Spotify listeners</a> and definitely more streams overall than Kendrick, the Compton lyricist's diss tracks are out-streaming his rival's own. If you total all the YouTube and Spotify numbers for all these applicable diss tracks, Mr. Morale beats the 6ix God 883 million to 591.1 million.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, there are some rumors that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">this isn't the end of the battle</a>. However, we'd be more inclined to believe that there will only be subliminals from here on out unless someone fires yet again. With all the wildness of 2024 so far, who's to say what happens? But one thing's for sure: no matter the course of the next few months, Kendrick Lamar and Drake are making some big bags this year.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures.
