Another livestock agent also pulls his firearm, and the crowd begins filming and taunting. The sheriff later shows up and chastises Kayce for creating publicity nightmare, explaining he did exactly what the crowd wanted: he showed unnecessary force. Kayce just gives his blank Kayce stare. Daddy shows up. He grumbles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The protest seems to involve a spattering of various issues, including the use of force by livestock officials (an observation hard to disagree with given all the raids, arrests, and killings orchestrated by agents over the past three seasons of the show), farming and ranching practices using cattle, and some other environmental degradation issues that we couldn’t make out. Leading the charge is the activist Summer Higgins, who John Dutton decides to charge with a crime over her rock throwing. He later posts her bail and picks her up from jail later in the episode.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The two go for a drive and reflect on the end of mankind, as the earth sheds its poisonous human skin during the final moments of homo sapiens.

Her character also seems to be something of a political foil to John Dutton, as their first interactions imitate the kind of ideological differences inherent in voting disagreements. In fact, it’s hard not to see Summer as a kind of stand-in for urban liberalism. Her confrontation with John and successive get-to-know-each-other joy ride through the ranch captures a kind of isle-crossing parley; they’re just two voters from different parties taking a walk in each other’s shoes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">That kind of characterization seems a bit off for a series that hasn’t yet broached American politics. Doing so now, and this late into the show’s run, feels performative. Some fans will probably see Summer as an unnecessary plotline meant to increase the show’s cultural relevance. At least, that’s how we’re reading it for now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">But Summer could also just be the show’s latest villain. Her ride with John is simply a rare moment of allyship before a real showdown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a38148552/piper-perabo-yellowstone-season-4-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an interview with Esquire" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">an interview with Esquire</a> earlier this year, actor Piper Perabo revealed that she would be something of an antagonist for the Duttons, explaining, “my interests are a direct conflict with the Duttons’ interests. But I can't say who I square off with.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Becoming a Duton antagonist doesn’t often fare well for Yellowstone characters. “It's very terrifying to come in on the wrong side of the Duttons,” Perabo said. “That was the choice though.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Whomever Summer squares off with, it’s probably not going to end well.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0"><strong>Who is Piper Perabo?</strong></h2><img alt="new york, new york november 14 piper perabo attends critics choice documentary awards presented by national geographic documentary films at bric on november 14, 2021 in new york city photo by john lamparskigetty images" title="Critics Choice Documentary Awards" width=674 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1353326645.jpg><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd2">John Lamparski</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Perabo is an activist herself and was even arrested for protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. She says that fact alone piqued Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan’s interest. “He was really interested in the story of civil disobedience and the sort of process of putting your body on the line for a cause that you care about,” Perabo said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Before Yellowstone, Perabo’s big roles included Cheaper by the Dozen and Covert Affairs, the latter of which earned her a Golden Globe nomination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHNrJ%2BemZyptW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSudISScGxtaWdkxqa4y6iurKyfo7Juv9SmpJ6qXZ22qLPIp6pmqJmlsrN5z56pmpqfZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
