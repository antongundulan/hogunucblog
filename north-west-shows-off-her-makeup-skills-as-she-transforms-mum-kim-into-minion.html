The video began with the reality star showing the makeup palette that was used.</p><p>It seems like North made use of four different color palettes to complete the look. She even made round glasses and glittery lips to make sure that Kim was looking the part.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Kim was happy to show off her daughter‚Äôs work as she posed for the same on social media. As of now, the video has over 14 million views.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-motherdaughter-duo-has-been-taking-over-tiktok>The mother-daughter duo has been taking over TikTok</h2><p>This is not the first time that Kim and North have gone viral for their content. In the past, the pair have come together for several videos and even have a social media following of 7 million.</p><p>Looking at their TikTok, one can say that the duo is not afraid to jump on viral trends on the platform. In fact, they have also used the platform to give us a sneak peek of what happens at a Kardashian event.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Kim posted a video that was taken during Khloe Kardashian‚Äôs birthday party. The snippet sure had everyone jealous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/08/GettyImages-1407169078-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-has-kim-said-about-north-being-on-social-media>What has Kim said about North being on social media</h2><p>While the two seem to have fun together on the platform, there has been drama involved for the same. A couple of months ago Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, had raised his concerns over North using social media as he did not want their daughter to be on the platform at this age.</p><p>However, Kim was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quick to respond</a> to this. The reality star noted that North was allowed to express her creative side with adult supervision. Kim further added that she wanted their daughter to be happy and was doing everything she could as the main caregiver.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS ON HULU FROM THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 22ND<br><strong>AND&nbsp;GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXaOyuL%2BOp6arrJhixKa%2F02aqoaenqHqwssVmn56qXaKurLHUqWSso5mhubR5wKxkrKCVYsGzrc2snaiqnah6rsHMZqKipV2eu7W7jKagp6Gfow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
