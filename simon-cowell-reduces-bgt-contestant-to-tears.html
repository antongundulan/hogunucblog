Julia Carlile, who is a member of group , appeared two years ago on the talent show and revealed back then that she may never walk – let alone dance – again due to the fact that she suffered from scoliosis. Simon was so moved by her story that he offered to pay for the talented dancer to receive surgery in the USA, and this year Julia was able to return to the stage and compete again.</p><p id=eAF_413icftF data-wc=72>Flanked by her fellow teammates, Julia and the rest of the left all four judges in tears after they lit up the stage with an energetic routine that included backflips. After the performance, Simon told them: "It is one person’s strength, and beyond that is the friendship and support; the fact you stayed together and supported each other and the fact you were able to come back tonight – it’s everything."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eMAqtI-inQPN data-wc=6><strong>MerseyGirls put on an incredible performance&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eUOWwv3dmVbj data-wc=59>Julia was overcome by emotion on stage and as her eyes filled with tears she said: "I literally thought by now I would be at home, not dancing for the rest of my life.

Earlier in September, the music mogul treated his adorable son Eric to a funfair trip, and although the adorable little five-year-old appeared to be having the time of his life, dad Simon was far less impressed. In a hilarious video posted to Terri Seymour's Instagram Stories, Eric and dad Simon can be seen riding the carousel. Being as cheeky and snarky as ever, Simon told his ex Terri: "This is the most boring thing I've ever done." Eric, on the other hand, was having the time of his life and was accompanied by Terri's daughter Coco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/065cffc64b8b-eric-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eukgk5yJLTir data-wc=9><strong>Eric is looking more and more like his dad!</strong></p><p id=eFPmPqx9Edp- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Simon Cowell's son Eric shows off singing skills in adorable new video</a></strong></p><p id=ej991A0fMJXA data-wc=83>Terri also shared a video of the group sliding down the helter-skelter, and a photo of them competing in a funfair game.
