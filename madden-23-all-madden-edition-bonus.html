As such, the pre-order bonus for this edition is, effectively, the three-day preview that is underway now. (There was an incentive for All-Madden pre-orders that expired July 22.) All-Madden Edition owners get 4,600 Madden Points, a premium virtual currency that can be used to get MUT Coins, which is the earned virtual currency of Ultimate Team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbvLsp6opl6YvK57w56YpatfZ4B0fJdwb2xnnZaxpbHNZmlsZZGhuW65wJ2bnqZdmrGqwMiopWaan6PCtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
