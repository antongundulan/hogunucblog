Mahomes has been instrumental in the team's success, but he wouldn't be as effective without the help of his receivers, especially All-Pro tight end <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>.</p><p>In an interview with former Chiefs quarterback <strong>Alex Smith</strong> on SiriusXM NFL Radio, <strong>Kelce</strong> discussed his relationship with <strong>Mahomes</strong> and how they function together within the Chiefs offense. Smith asked Kelce about their connection and how it has developed over time, and Kelce gave a detailed response, highlighting Mahomes' ability to improvise and throw the ball anywhere on the field.</p><p>Kelce explained that the chemistry between him and Mahomes has been built over countless hours of practice and preparation in the offseason. "Going full speed, every single rep in the offseason and training camps. Those are all instincts that you build for in-game decisions," he said.</p><p>He also spoke about the excitement that comes with broken-down plays and how Mahomes' ability to improvise makes those situations more fun. "It's really just backyard ball, you just go to the open spot and let Pat kind of throw you open," Kelce said.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Smith helped to develop Kelce's career</h2><p>While <strong>Kelce</strong> has formed a legendary relationship with <strong>Mahomes</strong>, his rapport with <strong>Smith</strong> was equally deadly for opposing defenses before 2017. Smith played a key role in mentoring both Kelce and Mahomes during his time in <strong>Kansas City</strong>, and his impact on their trajectories cannot be overlooked.</p><p>In summary, Kelce's interview sheds light on the chemistry between him and Mahomes and how they have developed such a deadly connection on the field. It also highlights the importance of practice and preparation in building that chemistry and the impact of mentors like Smith on rising stars in the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeblru0rdJmmqKsqWKwqbXEn6poamBngHB8lGhobWdmaYNxfpGbmZ5qZ2WBprDEamlxmmRqr3d6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
