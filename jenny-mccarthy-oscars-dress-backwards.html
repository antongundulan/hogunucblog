"The funny thing is, I went to the Oscars once. They invited me when I was the It Girl. They invite the It Girl each year. I only was invited once, obviously," McCarthy told the hosts. "I was literally working at a Polish grocery store a year and a half prior to me going to the Oscars, so I just didn’t know much. They put me in a Valentino dress—I didn't know I wore the dress backwards."</p><p>At that point, Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos were both shocked, asking what McCarthy meant about the backward dress. And apparently, she found out from Valentino Garavani himself that she was wearing it the wrong way.</p><p>Still, wearing something backward can be a statement of its own, right? Ripa defended McCarthy's inadvertent style choice, saying, "If that's the back of the dress, I mean, it should be the front of the dress."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bRSN9YmbiSfF3uCrHzN6Ff-1920-80.jpg><p>McCarthy also discussed the faux pas with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/jenny-mccarthy-on-her-most-embarrassing-wardrobe-malfunction-of-all-time-video-w472893/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Us Weekly</u></a>, telling the outlet "I just remember dying a little bit … Needless to say, I've never been dressed by Valentino again." But as Ripa told the actress, the mistake is nothing to be embarrassed of—and McCarthy still looked every bit the It Girl.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
