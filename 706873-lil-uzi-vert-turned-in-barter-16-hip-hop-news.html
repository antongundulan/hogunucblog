The project was an instant hit becoming the first rap album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 in 2023. But pretty much immediately after the project dropped Uzi began teasing another project. That album is Barter 16 which is reportedly a tribute to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a> carrying in the line of his Barter releases. The promotion for the record has included working with a number of Young Thug's regular collaborators and even Uzi dressing up as Thug at public events.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was one of those collaborators who broke some news that fans are pretty excited to hear. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>London On Da Track</a>, who is executive producing the album tweeted out that it had just been turned in. Even with that seemingly confirming that the album would be released soon, some fans were still skeptical. It's hard to blame them after how many announcements and delays many of Uzi's albums go through before they're released. "Uzi really tricking y’all again," one commenter says assuming that the record won't actually be coming out soon. "Soon = anywhere from 2 months to 4 years," another comment agrees.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-uzi-vert-s-barter-16-could-be-here-soon>Lil Uzi Vert's "Barter 16" Could Be Here Soon</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last week, numerous songs that are alleged to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">come from Barter 16 leaked online</a>. While some were pretty high quality and one even featured Young Thug, many fans weren't happy about it. Many instantly thought that the leaking of material from the project wouldn't do anything but cause Lil Uzi Vert to delay it even further.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Uzi has also shared the album's cover art, which also fittingly pays tribute to Young Thug. The picture recreates the album cover from Thugger's Barter 6 mixtape in 2015. Uzi recreated the lighting and composition of the original cover <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">in pretty accurate detail</a>.
