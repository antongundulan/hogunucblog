But do not do this too often, because it can become annoying for him. The idea here is to create an atmosphere of pleasant, accidental meetings. This is very important for the next step.</p><ul><li>Keep yourself calm and do not lose your head</li></ul><p class=align-left>You should not be too explicit and tenacious in attempts to win the heart of a guy. However, this does not mean that you need to hide your interest or pretend that you are not interested. You just need to show that you are interested, but emotions should not overwhelm you.</p><p class=align-left>As for communication at this stage: for example, try to insert a few compliments while you are talking to him. Use simple compliments without exaggerations. Show that you have an interesting life, mention some of the fun things you did this week. This is one way to create connection and reduce your possible worries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dde887a930a42f35.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best tips on how to get a boyfriend</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e2bc95bc2c2cdae6.jpg><ul><li>Make him laugh</li></ul><p class=align-left>Often the key to a person’s heart lies through his sense of humor.
