Per the <a href=#>Orlando Sentinel</a>, the couple put the 3,200 square-foot home up for sale for $870,000 in 1999 with plans "to move to larger quarters." Underwood could afford to live more lavishly, as he pieced together an impressive acting career in both television and film. The "Dear White People" actor has a net worth of $8 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>That said, Underwood does not define his success by the zeros in his bank account. "What makes someone successful in their mind by their rules, not societal standards? One of my definitions of success is being truly happy in what you do," he said during a commencement speech at American InterContinental University in 2015, via <a href=#>Ebony</a>. The accomplished actor was even asked by <a href=#>Essence</a> in 2020 how men should cope if their partner is the breadwinner in the relationship. "If she's able to go out there and make more money than you then deal with it," he told the publication.</p><p dir=ltr>Not only has Underwood sustained a long-running acting career, but he has been prolific in philanthropy as well. In 1993 he was awarded the Humanitarian Award for his work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association, per <a href=#>PR Newswire</a>. Underwood has also been a long-time AIDS advocate and co-founded the Artists for a New South Africa advocacy group, per <a href=#>AIDS Health</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWplbH96e8eormalpZi1brXSZpmlmZmnera6w56psKefmXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
